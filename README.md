NOTE: Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the finalization of these data sets will be delayed 
until roughly June (the volume _Advances in Ubiquitous Computing: Cyber-Physical Systems, 
Smart Cities and Ecological Monitoring_, which the data here accompanies, is scheduled for May).
Pre-publication, questions about the data may be referred to Amy Neustein (amy.neustein@verizon.net), 
editor of _Advances_.  Suggestions about additional data sets in the fields of bioacoustics, 
computational linguistics (especially dependency grammar parses using CoNLL-U format) and 
cognitive linguistics are welcome.  We are prepared to enlarge the data published here with additional 
data that can be used to demonstrate concepts presented particularly in Chapter 3 of _Advances_, 
which would entail converting data to a hypergraph-based format that can be discussed in greater 
detail with data curators as warranted.

Let me (Nathaniel Christen, author of Chapter 3) take this opportunity to invite researchers who 
may know of Covid-19-related data sets to present them to our attention as well, as (for a 
separate project) we are preparing a collection of data sets tied to the CORD-19 corpus.  Thanks 
for any suggestions.
