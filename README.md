For data-set information, please see info/dataset/README.md.
For C++ information and other background, please see info/cpp/README.md.

**UPDATE**
Currently, most data and code (still under development) is on the "ctg" branch. Switch to that branch for the README with more details.

The other branches are experimental and include numerous libraries which are copied from other sources with the goal of ultimately curating a general-purpose data set curation tool oriented toward biomedical applications, particular in areas such as immuno-oncology. These branches should be considered experimental and "work in progress" and, if browsed, with the understanding that the goal is to integrate 3rd-party tools along with some new components. Third-party licenses and attributions are not documented as clearly as would be appropriate for less experimental branches.
