`section.Hypergraph Grammar and Conceptual Spaces`
`p.
I think the motivation behind Coecke `i.et. al.`/'s syntactic
model based on Hypergraph Categories is comparable to 
my focus on `i.cognitive transforms`/.  In particular, 
their Hypergraph structure invokes the Category Theoretic 
sense of `i.morphisms`/, which are taken as the 
foundation of semantics: each word is construed as a 
morphism in some semantic Category (using this term 
in a mathematical sense, not related to `q.lexical` 
categories).  This applies also to nouns 
(and `i.sentences`/, analogous to what I call 
`i.propositions`/, embodied in finite clauses rather 
than words).  The Coecke `i.et. al.` model 
marshals a feature of hypergraphs wherein we can 
define (direct) edges which are not (on one side 
or another) connected to any nodes.  In conventional 
graphs, each edge connects exactly one node on eiher 
side; for hypergraphs, however, the `i.head set` 
and `i.tail set` of edges' nodes can be of varying sizes 
(including empty).
`p`

`p.
When applied to morphisms in Category Theory, this means 
that hypergraphs can model morphisms with outputs 
but no imputs, and vice versa.  Applied to linguistic 
data, input-less morphisms become nouns, and 
output-less morphisms become propositions 
(qua macrotype, using my terms).  There is a 
good cognitive rationale for this approach, at 
least if we want to treat words not only as 
linguistic artifacts but as, in some sense, 
names or triggers for certain intellectual processes.  
A noun, we might say, enters into the discursive 
space the `q.output` of a cognitive process 
%-- an act of recall and situating whereby we 
consult the word's lexical meaning and figure out 
how it applies in the current context.  
Parallelwise, a proposition can be treated as 
the final integration of linguistic data, 
which are `q.input` into our cerebral faculties.  
The point is that nouns have no `i.linguistically manifest` 
inputs %-- and propositions no manifest outputs in surface 
language, usually (except for cases like `i.I told you so`/, 
in resolving the `i.so` referent) %-- but we can 
still plausibly treat these as cognitive 
processes which generate outputs or take inputs, 
respectively.
`p`

`p.
With this added structure, all linguistic elements 
can be treated as interconnected via 
crossovers between inputs and outputs: when 
nouns are modifier targets, we can envision 
them as mental procedures that `q.output` their 
nominal content; when propositions are 
tranform outcomes, they are `i.inputs` to 
our cognitive machinery for synthesizing and 
contextualizing language artifacts.  
So the output-to-input link becomes common to 
all inter-word relations regardless of their 
lexical category.  The resulting architecture, 
then, is similar to the notion of parse-graphs 
which I have developed under the guise of 
`q.Cognitive Transform Grammar`/.  A sentence 
is a space of linguistic and conceptual 
`q.transforms` or `q.morphisms`/, which 
are interwoven via input/output connections: 
the output of one transform is the input to another.  
The network structure of these connections 
defines an flow of `q.information` or construal 
between different sentence elements.  
An example of `q.flow` in this sense would 
be specification propagation as analyzed in 
the last section: mesotype requirements 
tranferring from `i.dogs` to `i.neighbor's dogs` 
or singular/plural specification carrying over 
from `i.beer(s)` to `i.beer(s) on tap` to 
`i.a lot of beer(s) on tap`/.   
`p`

`p.
In contrast to Coecke `i.et. al.`/, my orientation 
here is more explicitly cognitive: I see 
formal models as suggestive, summarial views on 
the structural articulation of mental language-understanding 
processes, rather than as logical distillations of 
semantic machinery.  The linguistic literature on 
Hypergraph Categories (and similar mathematically-inspired
methodology) has a tendency, in my opinion, to 
gravitate toward relatively context neutral 
semantic constructions, and ones which do not require 
a lot of interpretive finesse.  One of the aforementioned 
authors' more expansive examples, for instance, is the 
phrase `i.yellow bananas`/, which they read in terms 
of (effectively) objective qualities of bananas 
(their taste, color, texture, and classification as a kind 
of fruit) in combination with the predicate 
`i.yellow` (also treated `q.objectively` as a region 
of color space).  They argue that the conjunction of 
the two concepts yields a more specific concept analyzable, 
in some formal sense, as an intersection of the two 
%-- specifically, narrowing the set of bananas to 
those which are yellow (and not green) in color.  
They moreover set out mathematical formulae 
defining this concept-pairing in quantitative 
terms (not to imply that mathematical reasoning 
is part of semantics, I assume, but rather as 
merely a demonstration that certain mathematical 
principles in the superposition of spaces, 
suitably understood, have analogs in the 
scoping of semanticized concepts). 
`p`

`p.
I question how far these quantitative models can go, 
since all but the most trivial concept-combinations 
seem to represent `i.selective` blending which 
is hard to picture mathematically.  For instanse, 
`i.fried green bananas` are not particularly green, 
and I am not sure how to `q.quantify` `i.fried` 
the way that we can assign `i.yellow` to a mathematically 
well-defined color-space (`i.hot`/, `i.sliced`/, and `i.crispy` 
are all concepts I vaguely feel are applicable to 
`i.fried bananas`/; but I would dispute that 
`i.fried` is somehow a conjoined predicate of 
those three %-- instead the adjective seems 
to stand in for a complete idea, a clause, 
like `i.the bananas have been fried`/).  With this 
caveat, however, the Hypergraph model of the 
structural `q.network` at play in a sentence 
does seem to remain a valuable paradigm, 
however we wish to model the concepts 
circulating through the structure.  
Given `i.imported yellow bananas`/, say, 
there is certainly a sense that our 
conceptualization undergoes an accretion which 
blends the predication of `i.yellow` and 
of `i.imported`/, and that output-to-input 
connections %-- the outcome of `i.yellow` 
qua modifier is input to `i.imported` %-- 
serve to suture the conceptualizations 
confirming that one specific ground-concept is 
being declared as `i.yellow` `i.and` as 
`i.imported` (instead of one yellow thing 
and another imported thing).   
`p`

`p.
In hypergraph grammar, sentences' syntactic form 
defines paths which lead (in semantically 
meaningful ways) between words, so that 
paths are formed by output-input connections.  
Along these paths we find some conceptual content 
which gets progressively modified and elaborated.  
Coecke `i.et. al.` turns to Peter `Gardenfors;'s 
Conceptual Space theory for a semantic 
framework adequate for, in effect, how inter-word 
`q.paths` produce aggregate conceptual meanings.  
At the same time %-- perhaps to reiterate 
that this is a structurally organized process 
%-- they endeavor to define the transformations 
along such `q.paths` (in my terms) in mathematical 
terms.  This is probably a good account of 
grammar's role in relation to semantics: 
syntax is constrained by the need, for 
each utterance, to impress on the hearer 
`i.the right path` to combine concepts appropriately.  
For instance, a path must join `i.imported` to 
`i.yellow` so as to fix that the yellow 
things (bananas) are also the imported things.  
So the broad outline of the Hypergraph-plus-Conceptual 
Space `q.project` is to use Conceptual Spaces 
as the conceptual terrain on which progressively 
more determinate significations can be defined, 
such that the need to convey that specific 
accretion of concetual details defines the 
parameters and telos which engenders syntactic 
form.  For each grammatically specified 
path among words on the syntactic side, there 
is a corresponding path within (a suitably 
expansive) set of Conceptual Spaces on 
the semantic side.     
`p`

`p.
Intuitionwise, I believe this perspective aligns with 
(what I call) Cognitive Transforms; my point of 
contention, however, lies with (I believe) 
narrowly quantitative models of Conceptual Spaces.  
To make the syntactic-path-to-conceptual-accretion 
concordance applicable to the broad spectrum 
of linguistic phenomena, we need a more 
general, context-sensitive and nuanced 
picture of Conceptual Spaces, which can perhaps 
draw on the diverse literature varying Conceptual Space 
models as one branch of Cognitive Linguistics.  
I will now consider some potential features of 
such an expanded Conceptual Space Theory. 
`p`

`subsection.Conceptual Spaces and Cognitive Grammar`
`p.
Spaces like color and taste, which have convenient representations 
in terms of axes and quantities, are recurring examples 
in Conceptual Space Theory.  However, this theory has 
been applied to conceptualizations in many domains, 
including verbs and movement-patterns; 
spatial paths and configurations; scientific theories; 
and structural parameters in the context of 
computer modeling, such as markup languages 
(a specific `q.Conceptual Space Markup Language` 
has been formulated which allows conceptual details, 
according to tenets of the theory, to be 
asserted with respect to fields and 
dimensions within digital/computational data structures). 
As such, we should not be discinclined to 
consider possible Conceptual Space formulations 
even if, in some domain of semantic relevance, 
we have trouble finding quantitative 
parameters as clear-cut as, say, `i.hue`/, 
`i.saturation`/, and `i.value` in color space.
`p`

`p.
On the other hand, even in its branching directions 
Conceptual Space Theory does foreground 
the (minimally quantitative) notion of 
`q.convexivity`/, and show a preference  
for concepts which can be paired (or gathered 
into sets more generally) on grounds of 
magnitude in `i.some` sense: tall/short; 
around/across (see `cite<[page 13]GardenforsPreposition>;),
ancestor/descendent (or more generally defining the 
domain of kinship relations by degrees of relation and 
forward or backward in generation; see 
What is a domain? Dimensional structures
versus meronomic relations p. 449).  
The cumulative effect is a system of 
analysis which foregrounds comparative 
boundaries between `q.competing` concepts 
(in the sense that borderline cases may 
be ambiguous between them) and/or concepts 
whose differences can be accounted for 
numerically in some property or domain.
`p`

`p.
I intend to extend this conception of 
Conceptual Spaces to place more emphasis on 
concepts' situational interconnectedness.  
Concepts are often paired up not in the 
sense of competing or dimensionally 
contrastive (e.g. tall/short) prototypes 
within some larger space, but rather in 
terms of `i.functional` connections: 
in general, for any given concept there is a 
family of interrelated concepts linked via 
co-operation in some situation.  The concept 
`i.knife`/, say, is inextricable from both 
a substance cut and a person doing the action; 
the concept `i.fried` inextricable from a foodstuff 
cooked as such and also a pan or pot where 
the food is placed while frying.    
`p`

`p.
When highlighting functional interactions, 
several factors come to the fore.  First, 
concepts are often delimited by their 
relation to `i.verbs`/: functional relations 
are usually established on the basis of 
actions or events in which different 
constituents play different roles: 
the action of `i.carving` links the knife 
to the duck, or the chisel to the wood.  
Second, functional relations such as 
nouns to verbs (and by extension to other nouns) 
are dependent on situational context: 
for example,  
the culinary role of knives comes to 
the fore in kitchens and dining rooms; 
so our most common knife-conceptualization 
becomes properly `q.activated` in these 
settings.  There are other 
contexts where we sometimes encounter knives 
(as weapons; as cutting tools for 
non-kitchen chores), and the 
knife `q.prototype` (to the degree that 
such a thing exists) is different in these 
contexts than the table knife for dining 
or the kitchen knife for cooking.  
So the first step in reviewing the conceptual 
`q.space` in which knives, say 
(continuing the example) are mentally situated, 
is to determine which context is appropriate.    
`p`

`p.
A third observation is that, even when we can 
identify groups of interrelated and 
overlapping concepts, the contextual and 
functionalizing aspects seem more 
esssential to assessing concepts' proper use 
than assessing boundaries between concepts 
which are `q.peers` in a sense.  So 
`i.knife` can be contrasted with 
`i.axe`/, `i.dagger`/, `i.sword`/, `i.saw`/, 
`i.cleaver`/, and `i.reamer`/.  We can find 
certain quantitative measures which 
help define the relevant conceptual 
differences: knives are shorter than 
swords, narrower than cleavers, 
with smooth or serrated rather than
saw-tooth blades, and so on.  Perhaps 
these comparisons are relevant to visual 
cues which condition us to recognize when 
some implement is a knife rather than, say, 
a saw (but context surely also factors in, 
because we `i.expect` to find a knife in a 
kitchen and a saw in a woodshop, not vice-versa).  
But our inclination to construe an object 
as a knife (or, by contrast, a fork, spoon, 
glass, or plate) is surely driven more by 
an anticipatory sense of how situations will 
be functionally organized.  As we sit down 
to dinner, say, our mental map of the 
circumstance encompasses a matrix of 
expected components (the food, our place-settings, 
the different kinds of utencils).  
We are thus primed to anticipate certain 
specific objects, and perceived things 
in our surroundings fill in these preconceived 
slots.  We recognize something as a knife 
because our situational intuitions up to 
that point prompt us to assume that knives 
will be among the objects present.     
`p`

`p.
One question then is to consider how these 
contextualizing effects can be modeled 
in terms of Conceptual Spaces.  One option is 
to consider different `i.times` of relations 
which a concept may entertain with a verb 
%-- directed perhaps by declension cases.  
A knife's predominant conceptual role 
is instrumental %-- the tool involved 
in situations where someone is cutting something.  
Occasionally `i.knife` may be in `q.patientive` 
relation to a verb (`i.I sharpened the knife`/), 
or the subject of a verb, as in `i.This knife 
costs a hundred dollars`/.  A knife could 
be `i.locative` (`i.Nervously I fixed my gaze on 
the knife I was holding`/, 
`i.A marble rolled on the table toward a someone's knife`/); but only in the generic 
sense that `i.any` physical object could potentially 
be the endpoint of a spatial path (there is no special 
conceptualization available via the locative analogous 
to `i.give` a gift `i.to` someone, or `i.avoid` some 
unwelcome outcome, or `i.skirt around` a question or topic).  
`p`

`p.
We can repeat this exercise for many concepts: 
define contexts where they are often functionally 
relevant, and, for each context, identify 
typical actions and events (lending themselves 
to verb constructions) and the 
conceptual roles the concept in question may 
entertain relative to these, grouping roles 
according to construals not unlike grammatic 
cases (nominative, instrumental, agentive, 
patientive, benfactive, locative, `i.distributive`/, etc.).  This point 
is tangential to cases themselves, and morphology; 
however we can consider conceptually in what 
sense, interpretation, or circunstance something 
could be an `i.agent`/, `i.patient`/, `i.location`/, etc.  
We might observe, for example, that instances 
of `i.nominative` or `i.distributive` 
conceptualizations for nouns seem most plausible 
when construing knives in the sense of 
commercial products (`i.Twenty dollars per knife 
(in a set)`/).     
`p`

`p.
A related (and somewhat overlapping) classification 
could be to consider concepts in light of 
different Ontological registers, or `q.modes 
of existing` %-- what earlier I referenced 
in terms of `q.mesotypes`/.  For example, a 
knife is not usually construed as a `i.social 
institution`/, but a particularly famous 
line of knives might be cited as a proxy 
for its maker (analogous to `i.This watch is a prestigious 
Swiss brand`/).  A knife would rarely or 
ever be deemed living, or sentient.  Other 
noun-concepts, however, are more flexible: 
a newspaper, say, can be figured as object, place, 
or institution; also as a commercial item 
(`i.Sunday's paper costs five dollars`/), 
a stretch of time (`i.The paper takes less 
time than watching the news`/), 
an abstract textual content printed in each copy 
(`i.Today's paper has an error on page four`/), 
an information source (`i.The paper has all the
movie times`/), something sentient 
(`i.This paper believes Warren is the strongest 
candidate`/), or even metaphorically as a 
living being (`i.That paper has swallowed many 
small local papers`/).
`p`

`p.
How a noun-concept fits in to a particular context 
can depend simultaneously on the sort of 
relationship it has to a verb `i.and` on the 
Ontologial regiseter through which the concept is 
construed.  The newspaper example shows a locative 
conceptualization in different registers: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  His commute started an hour ago at the paper. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Her career started at the paper. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Start your weekend with Sunday's paper. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Socioeconomic research starts with your local paper. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

I'll propose the term `i.meso-form` to capture the 
ideo of `q.Ontological register` as a factor in 
conceptualization %-- which facet of something's 
being-in-the-world, e.g. as place, object, or 
institution, is highlighted in a certain profiling.  
Meso-forms are then the conceptual parallels to 
mesotypes: a mesotype-level grade of classification 
brings together word-senses which derive from applying 
the same meso-form to numerous different lexemes 
or lexically entrenched concepts.  Meso-forms and 
mesotypes thereby share the same order of granuarity; 
mesoforms are conceptual attitudes more specific than 
the uppermost conception of nouns profiling 
`q.obects` or verbs profiling `q.processes` 
(LangIntro p. 104), but coarser than the lexically 
established conceptualizations we learn for 
each sense of each word.   
`p`

`p.
Aiming at a comparable spectrum of conceptual specificty/generality, 
I'll propose the term `i.case-form` to express the mode of 
conceptualization involved in treating a noun-concept 
in a specific relational role `visavis; a verb concept, 
with the idea that many of these `q.relational roles` 
reciprocate noun-cases.  I contend that meso-forms and 
case-forms combine to supply a conceptualizing system, 
which fills in details readied for completion 
within the aegis of a given verb (establishing the 
functional nexus through which concepts are construed) 
in a given (empirical) context.  That is, I envision 
a framework where contexts, verbs, case-forms, and 
meso-forms combine (in order of insreasing determinateness) 
to zoom in on specific conceptual senses and interpretations 
called for in a given linguistic context.  I'll dub 
this the `q.`CVCM;` model.
`p`

`p.
The interpretations engendered by `CVCM; 
construe situations via networks of functional 
relations; and I assume that a large part of 
conceptual semantics lies in `i.which` relation 
a given concept is understood to fill.  
For example, a construction like 
`i.drive over the bridge` does not merely 
construe a spatial configuration; we understand 
`i.the bridge` to allowing crossing over some 
obstacle which otherwise could make the 
described path impossible.  So the foundational 
belonging of `i.the bridge` in this signification 
is the functional one of supporting/enabling 
the verb-subject to do the verb; the specific 
spatial arrangement connoted by `i.over the bridge` is 
a matter of detail, but not the crux of the concept.  
Anlogously, `i.I walked around the parked cars` 
figures the cars not only as a reference point 
for portrayal of movement, but as a functional 
impediment which creates a situation where 
a subject has to functionally compensate against 
the obstacle.  
`p`

`p.
Taking this last example further, I would say 
that functional `q.attitudes` inform even 
the most straightforward-seeming spatialized language.  
Consider: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:walkpast ->  I walk past the paper on my way to work. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:walkfrom ->  I walked from the library straight to class. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:aroundsculpture ->  I spend time around that sculpture every weekend. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:walkedthrough ->  I walked through the door, which was unlocked. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:crossborder ->  It took us an hour to cross the border. -> cog ;;
`sentenceList`
 
I read (`ref<itm:walkpast>;) as implying that the newspaper's building is in 
some sense an `q.aide` to the speaker's walking %-- it 
may help orient her, or perhaps walking the sidewalk 
beside an office building is more convenient 
than walking other routes (past stores or transport 
stops or whatever where the streets are more crowded).  
In (`ref<itm:walkfrom>;) `i.the library` is presented as a spatial origin, 
but the larger point seems to be that the speaker 
transitioned between two activities (e.g., studying at 
the library and attending class), and the spatial 
movement was the concrete implementation of 
this functional transition.  The functional framing 
predominates, I think, more than the spatial: 
if the library is fronted by a lion sculpture 
we would not expect `i.I walked from the sculpture 
straight to class` even if this describes 
essentially the same trajectory.  In (`ref<itm:aroundsculpture>;), though, 
we interpret `i.the sculpture` as a site of 
activity (I'm thinking of those landmarks where people 
congregate, play music, drink booze disguised in 
coffee cups, and so forth).  Both (`ref<itm:walkfrom>;) 
and (`ref<itm:aroundsculpture>;) feature 
their landmarks not only as places but as sites of 
activity, which lends them a functional (not merely 
spatial) role.  In (`ref<itm:walkedthrough>;), the most likely interpretation 
is that the speaker both `i.opened` and `i.walked through` 
to door, the latter playing the functional role of 
abetting access into a building (not just the 
spatial status of a boundary between inside and outside).  
Likewise in (`ref<itm:crossborder>;) we understand `i.the border` not 
just as a geographical divider but as a functional 
barrier where nations can deny entry, thereby 
framing the border as a `i.process` since 
peoples' entry has to be authorized.  See: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The border took an hour. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The border is closed. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Neither construction makes sense for `i.border` 
qua one-dimensional spatial boundary.
`p`

`p.
I believe we should emphasize the functional-network 
dimension of concepts when applying both `Gardenfors;'s 
Conceptual Space Theory and Langacker's theories of 
domains and of spatial schema.  Functional considerations 
are relevant even in what may seem like the most 
phenomenologically elemental domains, like space 
(as the preceding examples suggest) or color.  I 
will expand on this later in the section.  
`p`

`subsection.Case-Forms and the Semantics of Verbs`
`p.
In his `i.Geometry of Meaning`/, `Gardenfors; 
suggests that Conceptual Space Theory `q.can be seen 
as combining frames with prototype theory` (p. 49), 
referring to `q.semantic frames` in the sense of 
Charles Fillmore's case grammar.  `Gardenfors; 
suggests however that `q.by highlighting the geometric 
structure of the relevant domains, one obtains a richer 
way of modeling various semantic aspects`/.  So 
`q.ideas similar to frame theory turn up in the 
conceptual space analysis of the meanings of verbs`/, 
but `Gardenfors; suggests that by identifying `q.geometric 
structure` operative in verb semantics, his theory adds 
greater detail to an underlying case grammar framework.
`p`

`p.
It is true that merely notating which situational roles 
are played by various objects %-- by various `i.participants` 
in a focal `i.process`/, to use terminology aligned with
Langacker's %-- does not get very far toward a thorough 
semantic analysis.  Expressing `i.cut with a knife`/, say, 
introduces the knife as an instrumentive participant, but 
we still need to account for how conversants ascribe `i.meaning` 
to the clause once the instrumental (plus nomitative and 
accusative) roles are marked.  `Gardenfors; fills in some analysis 
via his analysis of the `q.structure of events` which then 
engenders a theory of verb-meanings; in particular, `Gardenfors; 
focuses on the agent/patient relationship and the structure 
of the agent's effect on the patient.  His theory 
concentrates on two parameters structuring verbs' 
applicability to situations: a contrast between 
`q.force` and `q.result` and a proposal that verbs profile 
changes in `q.single domains`/.  The force/result 
contrast can be seen in `i.cut with a knife`/, say, 
where the `i.force` vector is signified as applying pressure 
against the patient, through the sharp part of the 
knife (the blade-edge); and the `i.result` vector is a 
path through a `q.state space` which is the rationale 
for the cutting.  If, say, we cut a whole baker's 
chocolate block into smaller pieces, the state-change 
corresponds to the size of each piece being smaller 
(while the number of pieces increases).   
`p`

`p.
The force/result distinction certainly seems 
relevant to how many processes (and so the 
verbs that profile them) are construed.  
`Gardenfors;'s `q.single domain` thesis seems 
plausible but not without counter-examples: 
for me, say, `i.explode`/, `i.collapse`/, or 
`i.melt` each suggest several dimensions of 
change.  If something `i.explodes`/, we tend 
to expect an `i.upward` and `i.outward` force 
and also something like fire, heat, or igniting.  
If a car bursts into flames but stays mostly 
intact, we would say that it `i.caught fire` 
more readily than `i.exploded`/.  If, conversely, 
a car is broken apart (in an accident, say), we 
might say it `i.was destroyed`/, not that it 
`i.exploded`/.  Granted, `q.explode` implies an 
internal force breaking something apart and 
pushing the parts outward; but `i.usually` the 
force is also driven by `q.fire` of some part; 
the verb seems less apropos in the case of a 
bottle broken apart by the internal pressure 
of `i.freezing`/, as when someone accidentally 
leaves a glass water bottle in the freezer.    
`p`

`p.
Likewise, `i.collapse` implies a trajectory both 
outward and downward: an explosion `i.upward` would 
not be desribed as a `i.collapse`/.  But an orderly 
descent, without the effect of breaking apart and 
parts scattering, would not be a `i.collapse` 
either; we would say `i.the elevator descended 
to the lobby`/, not `i.the elevator collapsed 
on the lobby`/.  Similarly, `i.melt` implies 
both that something (chocolate, say) is both being 
heated and changing shape; melted chocolate is 
both warm (while it is melted) and liquid.  Relatedly, 
if I say that liquid in a pan has `i.cooked away` 
or `i.cooked off` I imply both that the liquid was 
heated and that the amount of liquid has diminished. 
There is of course a `i.physical` connection between 
these phenomena: heat turns solids into liquids, and 
causes liquids to evaporate; but I question whether 
this physicalistic correlation automatically 
drives the verb to encompasss both aspects of the 
change.  After all, other verbs seem to profile 
one dimension and sideline the other: I could say 
that a sauce `i.boils`/, foregrounding its temperature 
increase and leaving implicit, if anything, the fact 
that some liquid might evaporate; or conversely that 
a sauce `i.reduced` or `i.thickened` without thematizing 
that heat and evaporation was the power behind that 
process.  In that case `i.cook away`/, `i.cook down`/, 
or `i.cook off` appears to merge two dimensions of 
change which are separable insofar as other verbs 
profile one or the other.

Along the same lines, the force behind a bridge 
(say) could be seen as a vector pushing both down 
and outward, so the two facets of the bridge 
`i.falling` and `i.breaking apart` are manifestations 
of one underlying impetus.  Here again, though, 
I am more convinced by the analysis that we hear 
the verb profiling two aspects of change which 
are independently construed and assessed: the 
fact of the bridge being no longer elevated and 
the fact of its being ruptured or broken apart; 
these carry distinct consequences and visual 
schema.  The case for verbs in these examples 
profiling a process split across at least two 
dimensions, instead of one hybrid dimension, 
seems stronger than the converse.  Such arguments 
do not refute `Gardenfors;'s point that 
verbs `i.most often` profile one single dimension 
of change; but they do reveal this as a tendency 
rather than a a structural invariant in verb meanings. 
`p`

`p.
The motivation behind `Gardenfors;'s `q.geometric` 
elucidation of verb meanings appears to be 
one of isolating a matrix of paramaters by 
which individual verbs may be classified.  
Insofar as verbs profile changes which can be 
rigorously modeled as changes in some state-space, 
we can give a formal representation of verb 
meanings.  On the other hand, if we consider 
the full spectrum of participants 
to verb-profiled processes %-- not only 
agents and patients but instruments, benefactors, 
locations, and so forth %-- it seems plausible 
that certain prototypical roles are simply 
entrenched as lexical features in normal usages.  
For example, most people first become acquainted 
with knives through cutting food at a dinner 
table (or a kitchen).  Hypothetically, 
then, the `i.instrumental` role of a 
knife in certain specific cutting scenarios 
%-- in terms of where and to what ends it occurs, 
and what substance is cut %-- is a paradigm 
which dominates other contexts.  Therefore, 
pairing `i.knife` as as intrument with 
`i.cut` as a verb activates a lexically 
entrenched notion of `q.cut` (and of 
`i.knife`/).  To the degree that this 
pairing serves as a kind of para-lexical 
gestalt, our automatic activation of 
the relevant situational `q.frame` 
arguably precludes our cognitively 
attending to the force-dynamics 
involved in the curring process.
`p`

`p.
Recall my proposal that in expressions like 
`i.cut ... with a knife` I consider 
`i.with` a two-stage modifier, which both 
modifies `i.knife` (signaling that we should 
construe the knife in its guise as an instrument, 
and not, say, an accusative like 
`i.sharpened/polished/bought the knife`/) 
and then modifies `i.cut` (adding the detail 
of the instrument used for the cutting).  
The `i.with`/`i.knife` relation (along with 
`i.cut`/`i.knife` for context) is then a 
transform which concretizes how the concept 
`i.knife` fits in to the relevant expression: 
we have to `q.activate` a proper sense 
of knife as `i.instrument`/; not agent or patient, 
or even location or benefactor, 
etc. (cf. `i.a bug crawling on the knife`/, 
`i.my gaze was drawn to the knife in her hand`/, 
`i.a sheath for the knife`/).  In general, a 
verb's relation to an process participant 
triggers a reconceptualization of that 
participant, depending on its participatory role.       
`p`

`p.
`Gardenfors;'s Conceptual Space theory of verbs 
provides us with a structural framework for 
modeling the logical (or `q.geometrical`/) 
parameters of such participatory roles.  I would 
question, however, to what degree lexical 
conventions simply preempt our cognitively 
exploiting such logical structure as a 
vehicle for elucidating verb meanings 
(through the network of process-participant 
relations forming a complete clause).  
A further complication is that we often 
conceptualize processes in relation to 
other processes: we cut food, for example, 
so as to more conveniently eat it.  
Or, we open a bottle of beer so as to 
drink it.  If I open a bottle, or see someone 
else doing so, I am usually only dimly aware 
of the actual direction of force and 
movement whereby the cap is extricated 
from the bottle.  I am more engrossed 
in the anticipitory protention of grasping 
the opened bottle and drinking from it.  
`p`

`p.
It is possible to open a beer bottle without a 
normal bottle opener %-- with a hammer, say 
(using the head, on its side as a pivot).  
When someone does so, they have not 
suddenly expanded the lexical network 
for `i.hammer` such that the sense `i.bottle 
opener` is now one usage.  But nor are 
they applying force-dynamic rules to 
authorize the applicability of the verb 
`i.open`/.  The more proper gloss on the situation 
is that there is not very much going on linguistically 
at all, especially if the action occurs 
without social interaction.  If I am alone, 
thirsty for beer, wanting a bottle opener 
but not a hammer, and open the beer with the 
hammer, almost all my reasoning is 
extra-linguistic (although my deliberations 
might be spurred by inner dialog %-- 
`i.hmm, where's the bottle opener ... I can't 
find it ... what could I use to open the beer`/?).  
I certainly am not attending to the semantics 
of `q.open` while I endeavor to open the beer 
with the hammer.  
`p`

`p.
The force/result vector distinct has some relevance 
here, too, but I find it mostly an extralinguistic 
relevance.  I need to apply force to the cap 
to pry it away from the bottle, and the result 
of that action is the bottle's state 
changing.  I am not necessarily `i.thinking` 
about this process with any rigor, but more likely 
`q.feeling` it kinaesthetically %-- I have to 
position the hammer-head at the right angle and 
then pull upward in the right way, so the process 
demands a proper manual gesture executed with the 
right fine-motor maneuvering, so it is an 
`q.embodied` faculty more than a cognitive one.  
To be sure, once I succeed %-- and also 
before I even attempt to gesture %-- the 
situation falls into certain linguistic 
glosses: `i.I need a way to open this bottle`/; 
`i.This bottle is now open`/.  The force-dynamic 
and result-vector specifics of the process 
through which the bottle `i.was` opened 
presumably influences my proclivity 
to mentally summarize the situation as 
`i.the bottle is now open`/.
`p`

`p.
Still, the significance of the verb `i.open` here 
seems mostly to summarize, or provide mental 
access to, a fundamentally extralinguistic 
plane of reasoning/experience.  In this 
sense I think we need to be careful about 
how we posit Conceptual Spaces as 
building blocks of `i.semantic` analyses, 
in which we pursue the `i.linguistic` derivation 
of compound meanings from conventionalized 
smaller units.  Semantics is distinct 
from merely inventorying a lexicon, because 
the assumption is that lexical elements are 
arranged in novel combinations to signify 
non-conventionalized ideas.  A good example 
of `q.novel combinations`/, of course, 
is finite clauses where a verb is paired 
with multiple participants and roles 
%-- agent and patient, along with various 
other roles exposed via `q.case-forms`/.
`p`

`p.
We should concede, however, that sometimes 
the situational details of participants' 
roles is established mostly 
`i.extra`/linguistically.  If I cut a 
piece of meat, my attention is perhaps 
occupied by anticipation of the subsequent 
process, eating the bite-size pieces: 
the flesh out the meaning of `i.cut` 
in terms of the force and result vectors 
can distort the play of conscious awareness, 
where the parameters of one current process 
are mentally subsumed under the pragmatic links 
tieing one process to another.  In this 
case, I consider the act of cutting most 
specifically as an operational precursor 
to the act of eating.  Conceptually, 
then, `i.cut` as a verb profiles this 
point in a multi-process practical 
chain more than it profiles the precise 
mechanics behind its process per se.  
Likewise, `i.open` in the sense of 
opening beer with a hammer essentially 
(on my reading) provides mental access 
through one lexeme to an almost entirely 
extralinguistic form of reasoning.  And, 
perhaps in an opposite direction, certain 
usages (like `i.cut` when the instrument is 
a knife, the patient is food, and the agent 
is someone cooking or eating) are so 
conventionalized in word-meanings as to 
be lexical phenomena more than semantic ones. 
`p`

`p.
In short, I would argue that in many 
cases the `q.semantics` of verbs is 
preempted: either our construal of 
verb-to-process-participant relations is 
lexically entrenched and, as such, not a 
matter of semantic construction; 
or, the verb merely proxies for extralinguistic 
modes of awareness; or, we reason through 
individual processes in networks 
of functionally related processes rather than 
through granular awareness of the parameters 
of one process in particular.  What this means 
is that a potential Conceptual Space analysis 
of verbs is only a `i.semantic` analysis in 
certain circumstances, where lexical, 
functional/pragmatic, or extralinguistic considerations 
do not `i.pre-empt` an actual `i.semantic` integration 
of multiple verb/participant relations.  If we 
suggest that verbs are modeled via Conceptual 
Spaces through an agent/patient connection 
%-- that the agent and patient are `q.points in` 
or somehow semantically grounded within their 
respective Conceptual Spaces, and the agent/patient 
connection merges these space %-- then this 
`q.double-space` theory is only a `i.semantic` analysis 
of verbs to the degree that the juxtaposition 
of the two spaces is a `i.linguistic` construction, 
one that bears its meaning through a logical 
interconnection between spaces that yields a point 
or a path in a hybrid space.
`p`

`p.
The idea of using Conceptual Spaces to model 
linguistic `i.constructions` is perhaps more 
simply illustrated not with verbs but with, 
say, adjective/noun constructions.  To say 
`i.red apple` is of course to combine two 
different predications, one that something 
is an apple and the second that it is red.  
As a `i.semantic` theory, moreover, we would 
want to say that this combination is 
`q.generative`/; that it allows for the 
expression of novel ideas.  Arguably `i.red apple` 
is semi-entrenched as a phrase in its own 
right (like `i.red hair` or `i.green apple`/), 
but we could readily vary the example, to, 
say, `i.purplish apple`/.  This is `i.not` a 
lexically-entrenched usage.  As such, its 
meaning is somehow compositional: it derives 
from a structured combination of the meaning 
of its parts, in some rule-governed manner.
`p`

`p.
Conceptual Space Theory would like to offer an 
account of `i.how` compositional meanings like 
`i.purplish apple` are synthesized, by 
considering the compound expression as a 
juxtaposition of distinct conceptual 
spaces.  This means that compound meanings 
can be derived from semantics alone 
%-- `i.semantics` in the sense of a 
theory for how compound meanings derive 
from combinations of lexically-entrenched 
minimal units via the application of linguistic 
(syntactic and semantic) rules.
`p`

`p.
But even if we grant that compound meanings 
can involve the pairing of distinct 
conceptual spaces, we do not necessarily 
have a `i.compositional` theory of this 
`q.merging` of spaces.  Note first that 
some combinations are entrenched in different 
ways.  Even if we do not have specific 
conventionalized phrases like `i.red hair`/, 
we may have a case like `i.cut`/`i.knife`/, 
where the space-doubling %-- here the agent/patient 
relation and then the relation of the overall 
process to its enabling instrument %-- reflects 
a kind of originary scenario that grounds the 
lexical conventions of the words involved.  
The food/dining context is certainly the 
central pole of `i.knife` and arguable the 
central meaning, or one of then, for `i.cut`/.  
And in other cases the integration of 
two conceptual spaces triggers extralinguistic 
reasoning entirely, or is driven by an 
anticipatory and/or retrospective account of 
functionally connected processes, where the 
granular details of one process recede into 
the mental background.  If we experience 
`i.cut` as preparatory for eating, then 
we tend to think of the process solely in terms 
of the end result of yielding bite-size 
pieces %-- the force-dynamics of the cutting 
process is not, in such cases, in the 
`q.zone` of semantic connotations we actively 
associated with verb.  (In other scenarios, 
though, e.g. when we are stuggling to cut 
through something, the force dynamic 
may be foregrounded at the `i.expense` of 
other facets).   
`p`

`p.
None of this is to dispute that force and 
result vectors, or Conceptual Space 
`q.merging`/, is a salient dimension of 
situations which are approached linguistically.  
My point is rather that space-juxtapositions 
marked via grammar are not necessarily semantic 
`i.constructions` whose `i.meaning` is extrapolated 
from some logical derivation on the spaces insofar 
as they are juxtaposed.  Again, adjective/noun 
is a useful example.  When we use color words 
(`i.purplish apple`/), the usual implication is that 
the color names how an object `i.appears`/, and typically 
describes the surface, or visible exterior 
(an apple is white or very light yellow `i.inside`/).
This is not a hard-and-fast rule.  Of a white chocolate 
truffle dipped in dark chocolate, I might say 
`i.this is white (chocolate)`/; I might say 
that a red velvet cake with white frosting 
(or a clear glass covered lamp with a reddish bulb inside) 
is `i.red`/.  In short, we `i.occasionally` 
use color words to describe the `i.inside` 
of an object, not its surface.
`p`

`p.
In short, even fairly straightforward 
`q.juxtapositions` of conceptual spaces are 
`i.mediated` by a play of lexical, situational, 
and extralinguistic conventions.  The co-presence 
of two conceptual spaces may trigger 
extralinguistic associations, or may trigger 
entrenched lexical patterns.  And even when 
we allow that a compound meaning emerges 
from the structural interplay of two spaces, 
we tend to follow some conventional outlining 
`i.how` one space is to be thought or predicated 
alongside another %-- in what 
`i.sense` an object is red, say (usually 
but not always a red `i.surface`/).   
`p`

`p.
This discussion I think comlicates the 
idea of using Conceptual Spaces as a theory 
of semantic `i.constructions`/: as a theory 
wherein the precursors to semantic meanings 
are `q.plugged in` to some Conceptual Space 
combiner and the `q.output`/, of a more 
complete meaning, falls out logically 
via some intra-linguistic process.  Just 
as often, I claim, any word-pairing 
which may be theorized as a conceptual-space 
juxtaposition `i.triggers` some mental operation 
which is not strictly semantic %-- it may 
be lexical, or pragmatic, or extralinguistic, 
or some combination.  I will explore this 
further by continuing to look at simple 
adjective/noun juxtapositions.  
Continuing an earlier thread, I will 
present some arguments that even 
simple-seeming domains like color 
have hidden complexities that prevent 
even the straightforward application of a 
color-modifier to a noun target can be 
read as a purely `q.semantic`/, 
`i.intra`/-linguistic composition of meanings.

`spsubsectiontwoline.Functional Relations and Elementary Domains`
`p.
Color may seem like a prime example of what Langacker 
calls a `q.locational` domain and of `Gardenfors;'s 
quantifiable structuration of domains: we have a 
total, finite, dimensionalizable space including 
all colors, and color-concepts refer to regions 
(maybe `q.convex` regions) in this space.  However, I 
am going to argue that even color is more complex 
than it seems, and that we need to approach 
color-concepts on functional terms.   
`p`

`p.
Consider real-world situations where color concepts 
are situationally meaningful (and potentially 
then expressed linguistically).  The most 
prototypical such situation, perhaps, is using 
color to help identify something: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:redscarf ->  Please hand me the red scarf? -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:orangemug ->  Have you seen my orange coffee mug? -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:bluetable ->  Your keys are on the blue table. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:blackpurse ->  My purse is the black one. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:yellowcolumn ->  The yellow column shows last year's data. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:purplevase ->  On the mantle was a purple vase. -> cog ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Color words have a functional purpose, in these 
cases, of selecting one object from its 
peers (assuming there are multiple purses in 
(`ref<itm:blackpurse>;), multiple scarves in (`ref<itm:redscarf>;), and that the 
speaker has different mugs in (`ref<itm:orangemug>;)).  
It is also possible that the color designation 
helps the addressee to pick out a designated 
object in a cluttered visual field, even if there 
is only one scarf in (`ref<itm:redscarf>;) or one table in (`ref<itm:bluetable>;).  
In either case, color terms fashion a succinct 
description of some focal object's surface 
appearance to help the conversants syncronize 
their visual attention.  The functional purpose of 
the color-concept is to guide listeners to 
`i.that particular` object which the 
speaker is emphasizing.
`p`

`p.
In that vein, there are many different descriptive 
strategies which a speaker might choose to similar 
ends: maybe `i.wool scarf` in (`ref<itm:redscarf>;), 
`i.glass table` in (`ref<itm:bluetable>;), `i.chipped mug` in (`ref<itm:orangemug>;),
`i.gift purse` or `i.strapless purse` in (`ref<itm:blackpurse>;), 
`i.middle column` in (`ref<itm:yellowcolumn>;), or `i.antique vase` in (6).
These obviously involve concepts distinct 
from color, because they address fundamentally 
different facets of the object's composition 
or provenance.  However, even if we construct 
`i.color` conceptually as a device for 
individuating objects through the visual properties 
of their surface, there are still a spectrum 
of color `i.patterns` which play an analogous role: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Please hand me the plaid scarf? -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Have you seen my green-white-orange coffee mug? -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Your keys are on the checkerboard table. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  My purse is the striped one. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The cross-hatch column shows last year's data. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  On the mantle was a spiral-pattern vase. -> cog ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

I am not convinced that there are functionally viable 
reasons for treating colors as a separate domain 
from `q.patterns` in this sense.  Is true that we have 
a larger inventory of color-words than pattern-words, but 
this may be due to difficulties in `q.stabilizing` pattern 
concepts %-- to identify which patterns are 
sufficiently similar or dissimilar enough to warrant 
being subsumed under one concept (or not).  
Not that there isn't a certain `q.language` of 
visual pattern forms, in terms of symmetries 
and displacements (`i.striped` and 
`i.checkerboard` patterns have 
translational symmetry along one or two spatial axis 
respectively; other patterns have radial or 
reflectional symmetry %-- a `q.polka dot` pattern 
has double-translational symmetry holistically 
but radial symmetry for each `q.dot`/).  We could conceivably 
quantify a certain pattern-space by identifying 
the relevant symmetry modes and their geometric 
measure (as in, the width of the stripes in a striped 
pattern measures the amounts of translation where 
the symmetry is effective).  However, this 
putative space does not seem to capture all 
visually meaningful patterns, nor lend itself 
to obvious partitions into convex regions that 
would undergird distinct pattern-concepts.  
`p`

`p.
We could nevertheless present something like 
this analysis to explain the pattern-words 
which `i.do` exist, which appear to describe 
patterns that are readily recognizable and 
also readily distinguished from others.  
This suggests how lexical entrenchment 
depends not only on some plausible conceptual 
ground for a distinct lexicalized concept, 
but also on the practical facility for 
this concept to play against the dynamics 
of usage-selection: we favor concepts which 
drive selective pressures to choose 
their lexeme in `i.some` contexts and 
equally to pass it over in `i.others`/.  
Only certain pattern concepts appear to 
be very useful once such dynamics are 
taken into account (`i.striped` is 
perhaps the only spatial-pattern word in frequent 
English usage).  By contrast, several common 
color words are valuable within this dynamics, 
and more precise color words work similarly 
on the assumption that speakers, in the 
contexts where such words are used, 
face selective pressures to name hues more 
exactly.    
`p`

`p.
I think, then, that the dynamics of usage-selection 
and the merits of words having clear usage 
criteria can explain the proliferation of 
color words (as well as their relative 
popularity), and also the paucity of 
words for visual patterns.  On the other 
hand, I find this analysis pointing 
toward an account where colors and patterns 
are both part of a larger domain which is 
functionally active in the context of 
distinguishing objects by their surface 
appearance.  Within this larger domain, 
colors more than patterns have in general 
become entrenched via individual words 
(although we can profile a wider inventory of 
patterns with descriptive phrases).  
Indeed, `Gardenfors; point about concepts 
typically being grounded in `q.convex regions` 
within a domain seems apropos and explanatorily 
useful for comparing entrenchment in the 
context of colors versus patterns.  But 
I find this more an analysis of its lexical 
entrenchment than of the domain itself; 
and the tendency of color-concepts to be 
`q.lexicalized` more readily than pattern-concepts 
does not strike me as a compelling reason 
to separate colors and patterns as `i.different` 
domains.  Indeed, we can see solid colors as 
one sort of pattern, differentiated not 
by geometric structure but by the phenomenal 
distinctness of their color qualia.
`p`

`p.
These arguments notwithstanding, there 
are conceptual context (not just singling 
out objects of interest) where color-concepts 
are functionally salient.  Sometimes we do 
want to focus attention on a specific 
color hue for aesthetic reasons.  But here 
also I believe the color domain co-exists 
with other sensate qualities that become 
conceptualized %-- in particular, optical attributes 
like `i.shiny`/, `i.sparkling`/, `i.glittery`/, 
`i.polished`/, `i.lustrous`/, `i.glistening`/, 
`i.glowing`/, `i.iridescent`/, `i.opalescent`/, 
`i.translucent`/, etc.  
When we focus in on the aesthetic feature of a 
specific color, it is usually not only the 
given hua that creates an experientially resonant 
effect; instead we appreciate how light plays 
with or saturates the colored extent, creating 
visually pleasing effects.  Unlike patterns, 
our descriptive focus in these situations lies 
with optical virtues borne even by small 
spatial regions, so we can focus in on one 
colored region even if the larger object's 
surface has different colors on it.  We do not, 
that is, normally profile larger patterns in 
the conceptual attitude of aesthetically 
foregrounding the visual pleasure evinced 
by a particular interaction between color and light.  
But these aesthetic qualities are still not, 
in my mind, born by color alone, but rather 
by color in combination with optical properties: 
the beauty of a vase's purple cannot be 
phenomenologically separated from how 
its glaze reflects light; or the beauty 
of a glass's red from its semi-transparency.     
`p`

`p.
To marshal color-words as naming concepts in this 
aesthetic-optical sense, then, I believe we need 
to extend colors into a larger domain also 
comprising optical concepts like `i.shiny` or 
`i.translucent`/.  The color-plus-optical domain 
is different than color-plus-pattern, but 
this differents reflects the functional 
divergence in their use-contexts.  It is 
also true that optical attributes could be used to 
indivuate objects (`i.the shiny handbag`/), 
I think this is a departure from the functional 
`i.rule` in force for the color-plus-pattern 
domain for object-selection: in `i.shiny handbag` 
we are using a visual quality as a discrimating 
feature, but so too in `i.large handbag` or 
`i.round handbag`/; the point of 
`i.red handbag` or `i.striped handbag` is 
to promote as discriminant a concept 
instantiated by the object's surface, figured 
mostly as a whole %-- we are less likely to say 
`i.striped handbag` if actually only one small 
patch or logo is striped.  But `i.striped` 
is also a property that is naturally predicated 
of the whole, so being a general characterization 
of something's `i.whole` surface seems conceptually 
intrinsic to `i.striped`/; whereas `i.shiny` 
is predicated of surface regions on multiple 
scales, so that `q.holistic` element is not 
essential to the concept.   
`p`

`p.
Another way to say this, using Langacker's terms, 
is that `i.striped` is a `q.configurational` 
property whereas `i.shiny` is not.  But in this 
sense color concepts, when used to generally 
classify objects by their surface appearance, 
is `i.also` configurational, because using 
`i.red` as a discriminator in `i.red scarf` 
only makes sense if most of the surface is 
red.  The implicit rules of using color-concepts 
to identify objects, then, involve the named 
color being extend completely (or almost so) 
over their surface; we create an expectation 
of the configurational relation between the color 
and the boundaries of the relevant surface.  
So the color domain, at least in this 
anticipatory sense, is configurational in the 
color-plus-pattern case but not in the 
color-plus-optical one %-- which makes sense 
if we agree that `i.patterns` are configurational 
whereas `i.optical qualities` are not.  
`p`

`p.
Meanwhile, there is a third common use-case 
for color words as selectors among some restricted 
set: red and yellow cards in some football 
codes, say, or `i.black` and `i.white` in chess.  
Here the actual colors are only cues to 
conceptualization which may not even match 
actual appearances: with a chess set whose black 
piece were rendered as red we would still say 
`i.black queen`/, not `i.red queen`/.  Here the 
functionally relevant domain is not colors 
`q.plus` anything, but a small enumeration 
selected `i.from` colors.  In these smaller 
domains, most of the quantitative structure 
available in the larger domain comes out 
of focus: we do not really think about 
colors as more or less similar, or darker 
and lighter, when we are using a choice-space 
of colors as a fiat grouping device.
`p`

`p.
In the spirit of these treatments, then, there 
really is not `i.one single` color domains; 
instead there are numerous domains which involve 
(but are larger and smaller than) colors, each 
domain applicable in distinct functional contexts.  
I also believe that color concepts `q.migrate` 
across these domains: I do not think that 
`i.red` is a different concept when it can 
contrast with `i.striped`/, as compared to 
with `i.shiny` or only with `i.yellow`/.  
Instead, I think that their ability to 
manifest via one or another domain is part of 
the conceptual specificity of colors.  To be 
sure, this means that concepts belong to 
both the color-plus-pattern and color-plus-optical 
domains; as a result, the `q.dimensional` structure 
of the color pyramid (treated as a domain in its 
own right) has some analytic value.  It windows 
onto features of color-space which allow colors to 
`q.migrate between` domains in their particular 
ways.  But I do not see this domain as a defining 
parametrization of color-concepts; instead, we 
need to characterize concepts across all domains 
where they may be situated in one context or another.  
`p`

`p.
From this perspective a `i.domain` is not the ultimate 
origin of concepts but a specification which 
fleshes out context in specific functional contexts.  
We should characterize color-concepts, for instance, 
in light of the `CVCM; model I proposed earlier: 
where does a color attribution fit into the 
interplay of noun-roles, verbs, context, and 
construals which define the functional network 
relevant to each situation?  Note that in the 
color-plus-pattern domain concepts are usually 
adjectives, so they tend to be characteristic 
or supplemental details posited of their accompanying 
nouns.  In their more aesthetic, color-plus-optical 
guise colors are more likely to be subjects 
(`i.This brown would be perfect for the living room`/).
But the specific domains through which color words 
have information-bearing content depends on 
their `q.functional-network` context.  What makes 
a concept communicationally effective is an understanding 
of what propositional content inheres in 
citing specifically that color: `i.red card` in 
football endows the `i.red` with a different 
propositional specificty than in `i.red scarf`/.  
To recognize the information being suggested 
via a color-word it is necessary to overview 
the spectrum of concepts which `i.could` 
be invoked %-- not necessarily just by a single word 
%-- from its relevant domain.  And that 
space of variation depends on `i.which` domain 
is `q.activated` in the presence of a given 
`CVCM; structure in the surrounding discourse.  
`p`

`p.
This notion of domains being `i.activated` suggests 
how I am treating domains as emergent specifications 
dependent on a given functional/context background, 
not as the paleo germination of concepts.  This 
appears to deviate from the tenets (if not 
as much the formal models) of conventional Conceptual 
Space Theory, but it is also a point I would 
emphasize as an addendum to Langacker's 
theory of domains.  With respect to `q.meronomic` 
domains, for example, Langacker sees part/whole 
relations as bases for domains wherein the 
domain of a finger, say, is a hand; that of a 
hand, an arm; etc.  In these mereological 
orderings, Langacker seems to argue, one 
level of scale provides a conceptual `q.scope` 
for its immediate successor (in the whole-to-part 
direction); so `i.hand` is a scope for `i.finger`/, 
which is a scope for `i.knuckle`/, while 
`i.arm` is a scope for `i.hand`/.  

`quote,
To some substantial (though undetermined) extent, 
therefore, concepts form hierarchies of complexity, 
such that concepts at one level are presupposed by those 
at the next higher level.  To properly characterize a 
particular notion, one must invoke appropriate levels 
in the relevant hierarchies, i.e. whichever 
levels make available those concepts by means of which a characterization 
is easily and naturally achieved.  `cite<[page 148]LangackerFoundations>; 
`quote`

`quote,
For a given expression, degree of embedding correlates with degree of foregrounding and directness
of mental access.  `i.Knuckle`/, for instance, provides direct mental access to FINGER
(its immediate scope), which in turn evokes HAND, and so on. The conception of a
finger, a hand, an arm, and the body as a whole all figure in the meaning of
`i.knuckle` but lie progressively farther in the background. [para]
This layering has various linguistic manifestations. To take just one, a part can
often be labeled by a compound: `i.fingertip`/, `i.ear lobe`/, `i.eyeball`/,
`i.toenail`/, `i.bellybutton`/,
`i.kneecap`/, `i.thigh bone`/, `i.door knob`/, `i.window pane`/, `i.toilet seat`/,
`i.piston ring`/, and so on.
A noteworthy feature of these compounds is that the component nouns represent
adjacent levels in a whole-part hierarchy. ... 
We can therefore speak of a `i.door
hinge` or a `i.hinge screw`/, but the same entities could hardly be referred to as a 
`i.*house hinge` or `i.*door screw`/. (page 65) 
`quote`

This theory of `q.meronymic domains` therefore is centered on the 
thesis of mereological parts providing `q.direct mental access` to 
their hierarchically `q.adjacent` wholes (but less so to 
more distant wholes).
`p`

`p.
Without disputing this analysis as a point of fact, I would 
add more of a functional focus: we tend to conceive situations 
at a level of scale appropriate for our immediate concerns.  
If we are bandaging a cut knuckle, we focus on that 
layer of anatomical partonomy; if we are putting a ring on 
someone, we focus more on the finger that will hold the ring.  
We do not `q.put a ring on her arm`/.  We may be 
cognizant of the finger as a whole to which the 
knuckle belongs if we have to maneuver the 
finger somewhat to apply the bandage, in the first
case; and we may be aware of the hand if 
we need to lift it in a certain way to slip on the 
ring.  So the whole provides a certain contextual 
framework for the part (while `q.still larger` 
wholes, like the arm, less so).  However, these 
are not just economies of conceptualization: 
in practical tasks the immediate wholes are 
kinaesthetically, operationally, and so forth, 
more likely to be enactively relevant.  
So the patterns by which conceptual focus distributes 
largely in accord with mereological ordering has, 
I believe, a functional origin: we build 
conceptual blueprints for situations in 
anticipation of, or with feedback from, 
our enactive purposes.
`p`

In Coecke `i.et. al.`/'s `i.yellow banana` example, the noun 
`i.banana` is characterized via a conjunction of quantitative 
domains %-- particularly color, texture, and sweetness.  
Since this is a demonstrative example, we should not read 
too much into its simplicity; however, one open question is 
whether the dimensional predicates are simply properties asserted 
`i.of` (say) bananas, or are a `i.definition` of bananas.  
The authors actually say: |+|

`quote,
The subsets of points representing tastes are explained as follows using the case of banana
as an example.  Bananas are not at all salty ... and therefore 
[a `q.salt` parameter] is set to 0.  Bananas are sweet, 
and therefore the [maximum] sweet is chosen as an extremal point in 
the set of banana tastes. Bananas
can also be somewhat but not totally bitter, and therefore the point
[1/4] sweet [and 3/4] bitter is chosen as an extremal point.  
Similarly bananas can be a little sour, and therefore
[7/10] sweet [and 3/10] sour is also chosen as an extremal point.  
Finally the convex hull of these points is formed
giving a set of points corresponding to banana taste.

Note that here, we are using `i.banana` and `i.apple` as 
shorthand for specifications of convex areas of the conceptual space.  
These could be written out in longhand as sets of inequalities within
the colour and taste spaces.  `cite<[pages 16 and 18]InteractingConceptualSpaces>;
`quote`

|.|

The first passage here is based on a `q.taste pyramid` whose extremum 
points are salt, sweet, sour, bitter.  Thus the taste and color 
of a typical banana can be mapped to points in both color and 
taste space (via such dimensionalizations); and plausibly 
the spectrum of possible banana colors and tastes defined 
via `i.regions` in these spaces.  However, there are 
probably other fruits with similar flavor and color 
profiles which are not bananas.  Defining `q.banana` 
and `q.apple` as `q.specifications of convex areas of the conceptual 
space` would seem too broad, because it implies that 
fruits which overlap in these profiles are conceptually identical.   
`p`

`p.
Granted, though, the point of that example is a compact 
exposition; perhaps we can add further dimensions 
(shape, size, etc.) which more rigorously single 
out the `i.banana` and `i.apple` concept.  This still 
raises the question of how well a concept (even if 
sufficiently detailed) encapsulating `q.banana-like` 
qualities is actually a concept of `i.banana`/; I think 
most people would agree that bananas are ultimately defined 
through taxonomy and (in light of modern biology) genetics 
(although conversely most people fluent in the `q.banana` 
concept do not know the relevant scientific details).  
In any case, we should not proceed from the fact that 
certain dimensional structures inform predicates which 
are often `i.attributes` of concept-instances, to 
the assumption that we can `i.define` the concept 
by a sufficiently detailed admixture of dimensions.  
`p`

`p.
By way of illustration, one dimension we associate with bananas 
in some context is cost.  By analogy, when viewing an old 
vase in an antique store we can appraise it through a matrix 
of dimensions, including width, height, color (or pattern and/or 
optical properties), age, price, and perhaps `q.condition` 
(on a scale from damaged to `q.like-new`/).  It is not clear which 
of these dimensions should be deemed intinsic to the 
vase-concept (or equivalently the banana-concept) and which 
are relational properties relevant only in some contexts 
(like being `i.on the mantle`/).  Presumably bananas were 
the same fruit before there were people with monetized 
economies where every product has a point on a `q.price` 
axis %-- so cost would not seem to be an `i.intrinsic` 
dimension of bananas.  But almost every dimension seems 
context-sensitive somehow: bananas have a different color when 
peeled, a different texture when dried or pureed, 
a different flavor when spiced, and so forth.  So any 
`q.quality-matrix` itemized to capture the banana concept would 
need contextualizing caveats: consider the flavor, texture, and 
color of `i.unpeeled`/, `i.raw`/, `i.unseasoned` bananas 
(the fruit in the condition where you might buy it in a store).  
But in that case we could argue that in a `i.store` context, 
the price dimension `i.is` intrinsic.  If there is no 
way to define dimensional parameters without providing contexts 
where those dimensions (with their relevant bounding regions) 
are applicable, then we undermine the premise that some 
dimensions and not others are conceptually intrinsic.
`p`

`p.
For such reasons, I believe that we should treat 
dimensional structures as context-specific predicates 
`i.of` concept-instances (thereby associated with concepts), 
rather than bases for defining concepts in the first place.  
Various domains pertaining to a concept can be `q.loaded` 
as contextually relevant insofar as we apply the concept 
within a given situation.  For sake of discussion, I will 
use the term `i.variational domain` to indicate 
domains which have some quantitative or enumerative structure 
%-- similar to a `q.Quality Dimension` in Conceptual Space 
Theory (RaubalAdams p. 5).  The `q.space of variation` in 
these domains is responsible for the information content 
borne by a concept %-- the red card is meaningful 
because it is `i.not yellow`/, so the red/yellow 
contrast (not overall color space) provides the parameters 
which gives the predication its facticity.  When we buy a 
banana from a store, the domain of `i.price` 
(which has a variational structure involving dollars and 
cents, say, among positive decimals to two places) becomes 
an active participant in our construal of the circumstances.  
Whether or not this domain is intrinsic to bananas in 
general, it `i.is` an intrinsic feature of bananas 
that, as a food commodity, they `i.do` invoke the 
`i.price` domain in the requisite commercial settings.    
`p`

`p.
I think `i.variational domains` can play a theoretical 
role analogous, at least in many analyses, to 
Conceptual Spaces; however, I see variational domains not 
as conceptual backgrounds where linguistic operations 
occur, but as localized specifications attached to 
specific `i.points` in linguistic constructions.  
The Coecke `i.et. al.` model appears to render all 
linguistic transformations as morphisms against a 
preexisting (presumably very large) stack of domains: |+|

Consider again the sentence `sq.`i.chickens cross roads`/`/.
The nouns `i.chickens` and roads have type $n$ and so are

`quote`

In other words, this framework assumes `q.a vector space 
modeling sentence meaning`/, so that each noun and 
verb within the sentences are smaller vector spaces 
which, in combination, aggregate to the specific 
sentence (a `i.point` in that overall vector space).  
Their overall picture of how sentence composition 
relates to `i.meaning` is summarized as: |+|

This functor maps type reductions in the grammar category onto algorithms for

Here, `q.type reduction` reflects the idea that a verb transforms 
a noun to a sentence, so that the pair of a verb and a noun, 
were it typed as a unit, `q.reduces` to the sentence-type 
(they express this in terms of `q.pregroups`/, which reflects 
the Categorial Grammar distinction between modifiers appearing 
to the `q.left` or `q.right` of their target; but abstracting 
this word-order detail we can generically talk of a modifier 
as akin to a `q.function` mapping one type to another).  
In general, though, the key notion is `i.pairing`/, or in 
a mathematical sense `q.product`/: an intransitive verb forms 
a `i.product` with a noun, and the result `q.reduces` as a 
type (or in my terms a macrotype) to a sentence or proposition.  
`p`

`p.
Coecke `i.et. al.` then envision products in `q.meaning space` 
which reciprocate the pattern of word-pairing defined 
grammatically.  Note that the specific proposal is only 
that `q.type reductions in the grammar` map `i.onto algorithms for
composing meanings in the semantics`/: in other words, from 
this language in isolation, the establishment of a word-pair 
via syntactic structure only triggers an `q.algorithm for 
composing meaning`/.  Given `i.barking dog`/, say, 
syntactically deducing that the first word is intended 
to modify the second yields an `i.algorithm` for 
us to conceive the dog as barking.  Saying the syntactic construction 
`q.maps onto` the algorithm implies that, once we grasp the 
syntactic construction (with its relevant ordering and component roles) 
we come up with a corresponding algorithm %-- that the 
construction `i.barking dog` somehow `q.triggers` the algorithm 
not unlike how just the word `q.dog` triggers our conceptualizing 
a friendly canine. 
`p`

`p.
This basic picture of syntactic forms `q.mapping onto algorithms` 
is compatible with a cognitive paradigm according to which 
we have entrenched `q.compound` concepts alongside `q.singular` 
ones %-- barking dog, green banana, presidential candidate, etc.  
However, their subsequent discussions such as `q.yellow banana` 
imply that we can impose some mathematical machinery on 
the `q.composition of meanings` %-- in particular, 
as mappings within a suitably expansive Conceptual Space.  
The `q.algorithms` for composing meanings are, by 
implication, not so much `q.selected` from a mental 
inventory but are rather extramental logical operations 
preformed within the parameters of the relevant conceptual 
spaces %-- `i.yellow banana`/, for instance, logically 
dilating the overall `i.banana` region to something 
more determinate.  
`p`

`p.
This analysis, then, works best if we can somehow 
`q.quantify` the composition of meanings.  In that 
case the `q.type reduction` of word-pair 
`q.products` directly `q.maps to` a corresponding 
maneuver in a quantifiable domain.  The type reduction 
for `i.yellow banana` is, in this spirit, the 
derivation of a noun from an adjective-noun 
product; the corresponding `q.algorithm` 
is quantitatively modeled by restricting the 
banana space to yellow colors.  Similarly, 
an intransitive verb in `q.product` with a noun 
would collide an (in some sense) quantifiable 
`q.verb space` with an (also in some sense) quantifiable 
`q.noun space`/, resulting in a `q.sentence space`/.   
`p`

`p.
The notion that something so general as `q.sentence space` 
can be `i.quantified` may be dubious; but it is also 
true that Conceptual Space Theory has revealed quantitative 
patterns in non-obvious settings, so we should not 
prejudge that a larger exent of semantics than we 
might expect, at least, has some quantitative form.  
Within thix extent it is plausible that quantitative 
interactions between elements in a word-pair correspond 
to products in a mathematized grammar `q.Category`/.  
The more immediate concern I would raise emerges 
from my contention that variational domains come into 
effect `i.as a result of` linguistic construction, 
not antecedent to them.   
`p`

`p.
Suppose, for instance, I have bought a banana from a 
cashier for fifty cents.  The verb `i.buy` automatically 
invites four conceptual components: the seller, buyer, 
product, and the money exchanged in the opposite direction 
(actually this last component has two dimensions 
%-- the `i.quantity` of money and also its physical 
form, as when I hand over a dollar bill expecting change).  
In a sense `i.buy` appears to invoke a `q.configurational 
domain` in that the event which the verb profiles 
creates a `q.scope` of which the components of buyer, seller, 
product, and money are `i.parts`/.  This event %-- 
a `i.purchase`/ %-- is the domain for these components rather 
as an arm is a domain for a hand; except that the partonomy 
here involves abstract situational schema rather than 
physical composition.  I'll specifically propose the 
term `i.functional-configurational domain` for a case 
like `i.to buy` (or `i.a purchase`/) to highlight 
that the configured relations are functional, as opposed 
to, say, spatial (as in Langacker's example of a triangle).  
Most of the connections between the verb and other 
words (or phrases, like `i.for fifty cents`/) 
are then preoccupied with profiling the 
things which end up, in the talked-about 
situation, occupying the roles defined by the domain.  
`p`

`p.
It is true that in the course of completing the 
`i.functional-configurational` domain, we also 
have one component whose conceptual specificity 
involves a `q.variational` domain %-- specifically, we 
can associate an `i.amount` with the money transferred.  
So, `i.this` quantifiable dimension is conceptually 
part of the overall functional network %-- but only 
as a specification joined to one `i.part` of the 
network, or one `i.point` in the functional-configurational 
domain.  I believe that domains with quantitative dimensions 
most often acquire semoitic relevance in this general 
manner %-- the `i.overarching` domain is 
functional-configurational, whereas specific occupants 
of functional `q.slots` may play this role in 
such a way that we need we need to conceptualize 
a variational dimension to achieve full specificity.   
`p`

`p.
What Coecke `i.et. al.` term an `q.algorithm for composing 
meanings` often amounts, in the context of 
functional networks, simply to assigning a role to a concept: 
`i.buying bananas` elaborates the `i.buy` schema with 
`i.bananas` in the role of the commodity.  This genre 
of word-pairing fits into the hypergraph-categorial framework 
to the extent that we can assess `q.filling a 
functional-configurational slot` as a kind of 
`i.algorithm`/.  Less obvious, however, is whether 
a concept `q.slotting in` to a situational role can be 
analyzed in the kind of quantitative, dimensional 
terms germane to `Gardenfors; Conceptual Spaces.  
The Category-Theoretic intuition that syntactic 
pairings (qua `i.products`/) can be rendered isomorphic 
(in a syntax-to-semantic translation) to semantic `q.products` 
can only be reconciled with a functional/situational sense 
of semantic connections if we have a proper sense of 
a functional-configurational domain and its components 
as both `q.spaces`/, such that the residence of a 
concept in one components' place is in some sense 
within a `q.product space`/.  For example, 
the purchase-to-commodity relation established 
via `i.bought a banana` certainly situates 
the fruit in the `i.purchase` schema, but there 
are no obvious candidates to `q.dimensionalize` 
this situating in a fashion comparable to how 
applying `i.yellow` to `i.banana` tapers the 
concept of `q.banana-likeness` into something stricter.   
`p`

`p.
Having said that, once a concept is registered 
within a functional schema, it `q.carries` the 
potential for subsequent discussion of its 
properties, including those conceptualized 
in quantifiable terms.  The banana's color, taste, 
texture, etc., are all potentially `q.accessible` from 
the domain of the purchase insofar as the bananas 
was what was purchased; we might conceivably focus our 
conceptual attention onto one or another of 
those dimensions.  In this sense a verb like 
`i.by` does `q.act on` certain quantitative dimensions, 
but the relevant effect is not modeled as a transformation 
`i.within` the dimensions but as a kind of `q.indexing`/: 
from the verb we can `i.access` numerous dimensions, 
including `q.variational` domains, across functionally 
specified chains of conceptual relation.  
Assuming we can itemize all the variational domains 
conceptually relevant to all components in a 
functional-configurational domain, the multi-domain 
structure evinced through the verb is a kind of 
`q.product` over all those domains; but a product formed 
in such a way that the domains do not usually 
interact with one another %-- instead, they are 
latently present and may be activated in subsequent 
thought or discourse (an exception being dimensions 
expressly relevant for the functional context, such 
as the `i.amount` of money which the good costs, when 
in the `i.purchase` schema).      
`p`

`p.
Such a `q.non-interfering` collation of domains to some 
degree reflects `Gardenfors;'s notion of `i.separable` 
domains, but the substance of this theory is rather 
different.  One constrast is that the `q.accessible` 
domains are not (again excepting intrinsic specifications 
like `i.buy`/-`i.cost`/) predetermined from the 
overall situation.  For instance, `i.buy` does not 
expressly imply a `i.taste` domain (unlike, say, 
`i.eat`/); such a dimension is only accessible 
when the item purchased is food or drink.  If you 
buy a phone card or a transit pass, the `i.number 
of minutes` or `i.number of days` are quantities relevant 
to the affairs in that scenario, but have no 
correlates when buying bananas or batteries.  
With subordinate clauses, moreover extra domains 
can come into play via more elongated chains: we buy 
something `i.for` someone else, or `i.for` some event, which 
happens at some time in the future (these options 
adding extra spatial or temporal potentials for 
elaboration).  We buy a wine which someone else 
recommended because they tasted it in some prior place and time.  
The syntax does not just line up dimensional 
`q.spaces` (using Coecke `i.et. al.`/'s metaphor 
of vector spaces) as collated tuples of 
independent axes, like the basis vectors in a vector space.  
Instead, the accessible spaces are integrated in 
an organized fashion, so that the `i.chain` leading from 
the root verb (of a clause documenting a situation) 
to the specific concept (where a `q.Conceptual Space`/-like
domain is relevant) via fixed sorts of connections 
(verb-to-subject, verb-to-locative-phrase, or benefactive, 
instrumental, and so forth).      
`p`

`p.
A verb does not, then, predetermine what `i.kinds` of 
domains which may be accessed through its conceptual 
nexus (the situation which it profiles by focusing on 
a given event, action, or process).  However, 
it `i.does` predetermine a form of `q.indexing scheme` 
which orders the accessible domains against the 
verb via specific patterns of chain-steps: the 
adjectival modifier to the noun in the benefactive 
relation to the verb; the adverbial modifier to the 
verb in the clause modifying the locative; etc.  
This kind of admixture of domains is, depending on 
one's perspective, both more and less structured 
than the compound conceptualizations `Gardenfors; 
would call `i.separable`/: on the one hand, 
the totality of domains accessible from a verb 
are not just (in the general case) mututally 
independent, but (with suitable modifiers and 
clauses) unconstrained by the verb itself: 
a given verb (such as `i.bought`/) can be
anchored in a situation where many different 
unforeseen domains become relevant for 
situational specificity.  A verb does 
not unify only predefined set of domains; 
instead it forms a conceptual root where 
practically any kind of domain may become 
accessible, if it has conceptual bearing on 
those things which the verb affects 
(the verb's subject, objects, case-form 
modifiers, etc.).  In this sense the 
accretion of domains around verbs is less 
structured than a fixed set of `i.separable` domains.  
`p`

`p.
On the other hand, though, the verb does not just 
juxtapose domains; it also provides access to 
them `i.through functional chains`/, which correspond 
to syntactic relations such as verb/subject, 
verb/object, adjective/noun, adverb/verb, and 
their phrasal variants through subordinate clauses.  
Via these syntactic patterns, the verb's access to 
associated conceptual spaces is more structured than a mere 
collation of separable domains, because we have 
functionally inflected `q.paths` from the verb to 
the concept which a domain supports (i.e., gives 
informational content to).  If I buy a wine rated 
90 out of 100 for a party upcoming in six days, 
the domains of the `i.90` and the `i.six` are 
coexisting in the situational complex, but 
`i.buy` isn't just passively tupling them like 
a cross-product.  The two domains lie on 
separate `q.functional paths` emanating out from the 
verb, and so they coexist in our minds only 
in the context of our holistic appraisal of 
the situation with its specific functional organization.       
`p`

`p.
To capture the idea of these functionally orchestrated 
`q.collations` of domains, I propose the term 
`i.hyperseparable`/, meaning not only separable 
(in the sense of the domains being, in the more general 
case, independent of one another) but also 
indiscrimately `q.piled on`/.  A verb's (or clause's 
or situation's) family of `q.conceptually accessible` 
domains can grow arbitrarily, so long as each 
`q.new` domain is linked to the verb (and `visavis; a clause  
to its root verb) via functionally meaningful chains.  
Each verb and each clause, then, is on this theory 
associated with a space of `q.hyperseparable` domains, 
and this cognitive repertoire could perhaps be 
characterized as the Conceptual Space associated with the 
verb (and clause or sentence).    
`p`

`p.
I believe this kind of analysis is the best way to 
leverage Coecke `i.et. al.`/'s merger of 
Hypergraph Grammar with Conceptual Space Theory in a
manner that is linguistically realistic 
%-- in particular, that accommodates how a significant 
part of linguistic meaning is tied up in 
explicating functional schema.  When quantifiable 
dimensions do play a significatory role, it is because 
they ground concepts which are linked to situations 
via chains of functional organization.  Thus 
`i.quantifiable dimensions`/, or as I've proposed 
`i.variational domains`/, are one sort of 
conceptual gestalt `q.carried along` the mesh of 
functional networks which are anchored in verbs, 
and specifically clause-roots.  I would say the 
same, however, for deictic reference, 
anaphora, metaphor, narratively inflected 
language, and any other semantic lode 
`i.apart from` variational domains (like 
color, price, size, etc.).  That is, I am not 
convinced there is something dialogically 
special about quantitative dimensions; 
they are one genre of specificatory 
predication, certainly important but no more 
so than other builders of propositional content.

Once I tell a listener that I have bought a banana, 
say, they may have no particular reason to 
attend to any of its properties.  Instead, their 
natural response may be more functional: if 
I intend to eat the banana, I have to peel it, 
and my hands will thereby be occupied.  
While I eat it I probably won't be able to talk.  
I will have to find somewhere to discard the peel.  
My listener will probably make the slight 
anticipatory adjustments, factoring in the 
new detail of my banana-acquisition into his 
vague protentions `visavis; my immediate future 
behavior.  The fact of my now possessing 
said banana does not necessarily become 
relevant to him in any fashion which calls 
for quantitative models.  Likewise my 
interest in said procurement (and said 
eating) only briefly or quietly has quantitative 
content (the episode where I actually 
exchange the fifty cents and then, 
assuming we can dimensionalize tase, the 
quale of the banana's flavor, which I may only 
dimly notice).

Usually these sorts of functional deliberations 
%-- to take the banana I must pay for it; 
to eat it I must peel it; to avoid carrying around 
a banana peel I must trash it %-- are at the 
foreground of our conceptual attention.  Each of 
these operational scenarios, in turn, have their 
own functional nexus, their own verb-anchors.  
Thus, merely the act of setting up a 
functional-configurational domain is often 
the whole significance of a conceptualization 
(and of the language which expresses it).  
So in many contexts we should say not that the 
functional-configurational domain is a kind of 
recipe for assembling the meaning; often it `i.is` 
the meaning.

`p.
Still, consider cases where some added specificity 
`i.does` come into play.  Perhaps my companion 
asked me if the banana tasted good.  That 
linguistic gesture does bring the `q.latent` 
domain of the banana's taste into the foreground.  
This domain becomes a `i.potential` for activation 
as a consequence of the sentence (and/or the fact 
which the sentence describes) `i.I bought a banana`/, 
or some such variation.  The taste domain is 
not part of that sentence's `i.meaning`/, but 
the configurational domain which `i.is` part 
of its meaning creates a route to access 
the taste domain as contextually salient, a route 
which hovers for a while over our conversation 
(I would be puzzled though if my friend asked me a month 
later through whether the banana tasted good).  
So we can see certain quantitative dimensions or 
variational domains as potentialities that get 
activated along routes created by other meanings 
already in the discourse.

`p.
Conceptual spaces may have a secondary role in this 
analysis, but the same would be said for many other 
cognitive factors which are doubtlessly important 
for linguistic understanding.  For instance, 
any sentence uttered which includes the name 
`q.John` relies on listeners to know or infer 
what person is being named.  This can be a cognitively 
intricate process, but it is sutured to the containing 
sentence via specific functional chains.  
Analogous comments could be made about resolving 
pronoun references, or designations made 
with the aid of extralinguistic gestures 
(like pointing at `i.this wine`/), or descriptive
phases (`i.this wine` as a phrase grounded in 
discursive context).  We can build various theories about 
the forms of cognition appopriate for different aspects 
of semantics, but all of these interpretive faculties 
are situated in the overall dynamics of linguistic 
understanding via the functional organization 
of situations, as linguistically embodied in verbs, 
clauses, and case-forms.     
`p`

`p.
Conceptual Space Theory can in this sense be one of a federation 
of theories filling out our picture of semantic detailing 
`i.around` the verb/clause nexus, but none of these 
thematics %-- conceptual spaces, anaphora, referring expressions, 
etc. %-- profile the central backbone of linguistic 
structure.
