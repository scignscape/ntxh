`section.Propositional Content and Compositional Structure`
`p.
So, I accept, with duly noted caveats, 
that sentences (as canonical examples 
of internally complete linguistic artifacts) are 
associated with a propositional content.  Such content 
is logically structured and verifiable or falsifiable, 
in the sense that there is a conceptually well-grounded 
understanding of what would be the case were the 
proposition `i.true` or `i.false`/.  The sentence as 
a whole can then be seen as a commentary on that propositional 
content and the (maybe hypothetical) state of affairs wherein 
it obtains, or fails to obtain.     
`p`

`p.
Language is not, at least superficially, structured 
like predicate logic; so, the `q.encoding` of 
propositional content in linguistic forms depends on 
certain structural and transformational rules, 
wherein structures on the syntactic and semantic 
side map to structures on the propositional side.  
This structural association is `q.cognitive` in 
the (so to speak) `q.metaphysical` sense that it 
occurs in people's minds.  However, I suspect 
linguists would disagree on whether the 
language-structure-to-predicate-structure mapping, 
or `q.reduction`/, is cognitive in the more substantial 
`i.theory` sense wherein the cognitive dimension 
should feature as an explanatory source for 
theoretical constructions.  Again, I would 
propose an analogy to political science: 
the whole topic of voters' inclinations to support 
one candidate or party or another is surely cognitive 
in the `q.ontic` sense that voter sentiment can only 
exist in people's minds.  Moreover, some generically 
mental content may be introduced as explanatory 
parameters %-- voters are `i.concerned about` 
immigration or jobs or climate change; voters are 
`i.attracted to` charismatic or empathetic or 
idealistic candidates, and so forth.  However, 
apart from instantiating such coarse categories 
of sentiment, the particular mental world of 
any one voter is not within the political scientist's 
normal explanatory resources or theoretical purview.  
`p` 

`p.
For sake of discussion, I will use the term 
`i.predicate reduction` to designate the process 
or phenomenon of deriving `q.predicate structure` 
(treating propositions as constructions which 
build complex predicates from simple ones, 
and `i.propositional content` as propositional 
ideas which may be intimated even if not signified 
directly in discourse).  Moreover, I believe that 
predicate reduction can happen on several levels, 
since aside from a `q.base` propositional content 
there is for many sentences a secondary 
implication of propositional attitudes, 
which are separate states of affairs 
%-- my believing or wanting that Warren will win, 
or speculation of `i.why` Warren will win,  
contrasted to the baseline proposition `i.that` Warren will win.    
`p`

`p.
I also propose a kind of `q.tertiary` predicate reduction 
reflecting the various implicatures or indirections 
where the propositional content expressed by a sentence 
cloaks or alters what the speaker really means (often 
in conventionalized ways so that the intended meaning 
is clearly communicated).  So in a store `i.I would like` 
is usually understood to mean `i.I intend to buy`/; or in: |+|
  
`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:interview -> I would like to interview Mr. Jones, is he in his office? -> dia ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:available -> I'm sorry, Mr. Jones is not available. -> dia ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

(`ref<itm:available>;) does not mean expressly either that Jones `i.is` or `i.is not` 
in his office, but rather that (`ref<itm:interview>;)'s speaker may not interview him.  
The `q.basic` propositional content of a typical sentence, 
then, is often packaged in two or three extra layers 
reflecting speakers' attitudes `i.toward` that state of affairs 
and/or implicatures wherein attitudes toward 
`i.one` proposition (requests, opinions, etc.) are often 
conveyed via sentences which, taken literally, actually 
describe attitudes to a `i.different` proposition.
`p`

`p.
For sake of discussion, I'll simplify my own take by 
focusing on just `q.base` level propositional content.  
I suggest that linguists' methodologically differ on 
their assessment of whether the cognitive dimension 
of `q.predicate reduction` in this baseline sense 
should or needs to be foregrounded.  
To demonstrate, consider the most basic sort 
of predicate structure, realized logically 
by a predicate applied to a bearer, and linguistically 
by an adjective-noun pair, like `i.black cat`/.  
Logically, this apparently means that the predicate 
`i.black` is appended to whatever predicates are 
implicit in the logical designation of the suject; 
here resulting in a conjunction, something 
which is black `i.and` a cat.  Such conjunctive 
predication is, of course, a kind of ubiquitous 
logical gestalt.  The logical pattern is 
conventionally entrenched in English (etc.) 
via an `AdjN; construction (a noun following an adjective, 
while a similar construction in various other languages would 
have the adjective following the noun).  That is, a 
simple predicate-subject assembly at the logical 
level is linguistically encoded via an `AdjN;. 
`p`

`p.
This encoding, in a theoretical sense, is not 
`q.cognitive` because we can describe it as an 
objective rule of language.  The `AdjN; 
construction becomes something `q.in` peoples' 
minds %-- something `i.thought about`/, in the 
special sense of `q.thought` which accommodates 
cognitive competence, not just the passive presence of 
an idea in our consciousness %-- but it is 
an `i.object of thought` in the extramental manner 
that `q.complex numbers` or `q.the Eiffel Tower` can be 
objects of thought.  Speaking `q.metaphysically`/, 
`AdjN; is `i.in` the mind because this is its 
ontological mode of existence; but in the 
disciplinary parameters of linguistics, we can 
say that `AdjN; is only `i.in the mind` as an 
object of mental exercises; the basic rule that 
`AdjN; encodes `PredicateSubject; is a social 
fact transcending any one mind.   
`p` 

`p.
Via similar examples, linguists could argue that 
predicate reductions ultimately boil down 
to particular syntactic and semantic configurations 
with their specific patterns of encoding predicate 
structure, and that all of these are 
extramental `q.social` rules, whose cognitive dimension 
is ontologically necessary but not theoretically 
explanatory and therefore is properly elided 
from technical linguistic argumentation.  
To the degree that we can explain all predicate 
reduction by posing a logical formation and 
then a syntactic and/or semantic formation which 
encodes it, we can according relegate 
`i.cognitive` linguistics to a disciplinary 
offshoot, e.g. a `i.psychology of language` which 
differs from linguistics like how the psychology 
or mathematics differs from mathematics. 
`p`

`p.
Langacker (strategically, I suspect) riffs on `i.The cat 
is on the mat` examples (which have philosophical as well as 
linguistic provenance) to illustrate discursive 
context-sensitivity: |+|

`quote,
If someone says `i.The cat is on the mat`/, 
you are likely to envisage a typical domestic
feline reclining on a flat piece of woven material spread out on the floor. 
This is what
we take as being the expression's meaning. 
But does the sentence really mean this?
It would, after all, be quite appropriate for describing other situations. 
Perhaps, for
example, the mat is rolled up in a cylindrical bundle standing on end, with the cat
perched unsteadily on top of it. Or perhaps a decorative mat is framed and mounted
on a wall, and the cat is clinging to it with its claws. 
... 
Maybe the cat is a tiger in a
cartoon, who has just lost a boxing match ... 
Or suppose we are using a light-colored mat as a makeshift screen for a slide show. To
find where to place the projector and how to aim it, you put in a slide with the image
of a cat.  When the projector is finally positioned 
properly, I can let you know by 
saying `i.OK, the cat is on the mat`/.
Since the sentence applies to such diverse situations, what can we identify as
its meaning? One option is to distinguish between its specifically linguistic meaning
(a matter of semantics) and the fuller meaning it assumes based on extralinguistic
resources (a matter of pragmatic interpretation). There is, however, no strict 
dichotomy between linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge.... 
And if we try to factor them out, 
identifying as `q.linguistic` just those specifications 
shared by all an
expression's varied interpretations, 
what qualifies will likely be too impoverished to
be apprehended independently or recognized as a meaning. 
`quotepages<463-4>;
`quote`

|.|

Responding to these points, however, someone claiming a 
sharper `i.semantics`//`i.pragmatics` distinction 
might argue that Langacker's `q.atypical` imaginings 
of `i.cat on mat` scenarios all vary in their 
specific sense of `i.on`/.  So the `i.reason` the 
sentence has such competing interpretations is that 
its lexical building blocks have finer-grained 
senses which the sentence does not explicitly 
commit to: `i.cat` can mean a cartoon tiger 
as well as a pet feline; `i.mat` can be a boxing 
ring's floor or a decorative wall element; 
`i.on` can mean `i.perched atop` or `i.suspended from` 
as well as `i.laying on`/.
`p`

`p.
It is uncontroversial than natural-language words have 
multiple senses.  To semantically analyze a sentence, 
then %-- or so one might argue %-- we need to 
its lexical units not just as spoken or written 
words but as lexemes classified according to their 
most specific levels of conventionalized meaning.  
Imagine that `catOne; is the specific sense of 
`i.cat` meaning `q.small, domesticated felid`/; 
that `onOne; is the sense of `i.on` meaning 
`i.laying/spread out on top of`/; and `matOne; 
the sense of `i.mat` meaning roughly 
`i.small rug/floor covering`/.  Then `i.The cat 
is on the mat`/, in the most common case, 
is actually a way to enunciate 
`i.The `catOne; is `onOne; the `matOne;`/.  
(The other scenarios would solicit different 
lexical senses for `i.cat`/, `i.on`/, and 
`i.mat`/, so they are no really the same sentence).  
`p`

`p.
Of course, sentences do not mark via any 
linguistic data %-- no intonation or auxiliary 
words or morphological cues %-- that `q.cat` 
here means `catOne;, etc.  So there `i.is` a pragmatic 
and context-specific processing stage, indisputably, 
which leads the interlocutors to infer 
`catOne; from hearing `i.cat`/, and likewise 
`onOne; from `i.on` and `matOne; from `i.mat`/.  
However, on this analysis, pragmatics and 
semantics are still separate.  The pragmatic 
component of processing is fully articulated 
in the deduction that `i.cat` means `catOne;, etc.  
It is a matter of negotiating the granularity 
(or lack thereof) of surface language, that 
lexical instantiation does not get us complete 
to lexical micro-senses (just as pragmatic 
processing is needed to map from `i.she` to 
a specific person, or `i.I thought so`/'s `i.so` 
to a proposition).  By contrast, `i.semantics` 
concerns how meanings are assembled into 
propositionally concrete wholes once lexemes 
(and anaphora) are resolved to their finest designata.    
`p`

`p.
The separating of pragmatics and semantics is defensible 
even if the two are intertwined as processing requirements: 
the point is not that we `i.first` map `i.cat` to 
`catOne; (etc.) and `i.then`/, with all words fully resolved, 
our `q.semantic faculties` kick in and we put the pieces 
together.  Instead, we can posit that pragmatic and semantic 
reasoning occur in parallel, or at least in overlapping 
stages, with feedback between then.  Still, isolating 
the role of pragmatics within the discovery of finest-grained 
word-senses (plus discourse-related discernments, such as 
anaphora targets) points to a `i.logical` contrast between 
semantics and pragmatics.  Langacker, on the other hand, 
disavows any `i.strict dichotomy between 
linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge`/.  The 
`q.extralinguistic` aspect of `i.cat on the mat` seems 
to derive from our context-specific inclination to 
hear `i.cat` as `catOne;, `i.on` as `onOne;, and 
`i.mat` as `matOne;.  It is only situational context 
which warrants such interpretations, and not 
`catFour;, `onThirteen;, or whatever.  Nevertheless, 
it seems as if in this case the contribution of 
that extralinguistic knowledge can be comprehensively 
summarized by the narrowing of `i.cat` onto 
specifically `catOne;, and so on, whereas the 
role of `i.linguistic` knowledge can be seen as 
targeted on syntactic rules governing synthesis 
of those meanings `i.insofar as` they are 
extralinguistically filtered to fine-grained senses.     
`p` 

`p.
In short, although no purely linguistic or mechanical 
deduction could derive the proper senses of 
`i.cat`/, `i.on`/, and `i.mat` from context, this 
is not so far evidence that syntax and semantics cannot 
be isolated, as a pair, apart from pragmatics 
and from context-sensitive, extralinguistic 
faculties; or that thus isolated the 
syntax-semantics pair has a formal predictability, 
a kind of mechanistic rigor, which perhaps pragmatics 
and situational cognition lacks.  It does not 
preclude a computational model of sentences 
`i.once` fine-grained word-meanings may be 
resolved.  We could speculate that a software 
program could correctly ascertain the truth or 
falsehood of `i.The cat is on the mat`/, in the 
presence of pictures say, `i.if` the input is 
not just the sentence `i.The cat is on the mat` 
on its own but a more granular rendition, some 
encoding of `i.The `catOne; is `onOne; the `matOne;`/.  
Here the failure of such a computational system 
to understand the sentence of a human 
level %-- without the extra lexical prompting 
%-- would not disprove that language 
`i.per se` cannot be automated; only that 
language in most `i.human` contexts is 
inextricably tangled up with 
non-linguistic reasoning.
`p` 

`p.
This discussion suggests that a metatheoretic 
commitment to an isolated syntax/semantic 
pairing %-- assuming it is in fact 
theoretically desirable %-- holds up against 
certain forms of context-sensitivity such 
as highlighted by Langacker's analysis of 
discourse.  The paradigm informing such a 
metatheoretic stance would reflect a 
`q.backgrounding` of cognition %-- not actually 
a denial of cognition's role in understanding 
language, but a working hypothesis that the 
aspects of understanding which demand active 
cognitive interpretation can be theoretically 
isolated from a more formalistic syntax/semantics 
complex, which by virtue of logical rigor solicits 
cognition only in a passive, automaton-like fashion.   
`p`

`p.
I do not make these comments with the intent to 
defend such a mechanistic paradigm, only to 
claim that the problems with any linguistic 
`q.backgrounding` of cognition are subtler 
and deeper than context-sensitivity or 
pragmatic complications alone can reveal.  
One preliminary question, which I will 
skip over temporarily, is why we `i.want` to 
exclude cognitive explanation in the first place.  
Aside from that we can consider more detailed problems of 
`i.predictability`/, `i.contextuality`/, and 
`i.compositionality`/, which I will examine in turn. 
`p`

`subsection.The Predictability of Constructive Validity`
`p.
An intrinsic aspect of language constructions that 
directly imply predicate structures 
%-- such as `AdjN; %-- is that they are equally applicable 
to novel constructions as established ones.  
As new nouns and adjectives enter the language, we 
automatically have `AdjN; combinations using these 
new words as part of the language, too.  It is, 
in effect, `i.predictable` that a given `AdjN; 
construction is well-formed once the component 
words are understood as an adjective and noun, 
respectively. 
`p`

`p.
This too can be seen as an objective feature of 
language.  The observation that `AdjN; constructions 
`q.reduce` to predicate-subject predication 
is not only a claim about `i.existing` pairs in the 
language, but the stipulation of the `i.rules` of 
the language.  According to the machinery of 
predicate reduction for English, placing a noun 
after an adjective necessarily (in isolation) 
designates a predicate structure wherein the 
adjective supplies a predicate meaning and 
the noun its substrate %-- even if the particular 
combination has never been conceived before, or 
if one or both words are novel.  This rule can 
be treated as an abstract protocol in the 
encoding of propositional content into syntax 
and semantics, consistent with the idea of language 
as an abstract system for designating logically 
ordered ideas via non-logical structures 
(not illogical but not expressly based on logic).     
`p`

`p.
However, we can alternatively view the predicate-semantic 
predictability of novel constructions as a cognitive 
phenomenon: upon knowing that some pair of words is 
an `AdjN;, we predict that English speakers will 
`i.assent` to the `AdjN; formation being grammatical.  
Presented with a novel word, they will `i.predict` that 
adjectival constructions wherein it occurs are 
well-formed.  They will `i.expect` to be able 
to use novel nouns or adjectives in novel combinations, 
without addressees failing to grasp their intent 
of designating a predicate-subject predication.  
From this perspective, the predictability of 
constructions being deemed grammatical, and the 
clarity of usage intent, are mediated by cognition  
as much as they are mechanical abstracta in the 
language-system.  When we say that `AdjN; 
(for example) is a constructional pattern (in English), we mean 
that English speakers are disposed to accept `AdjN; 
constructions as grammatical so long as the components 
are of the proper syntactic categories, and are primed 
to anticipate using nouns and adjectives in `AdjN; 
formations, even if the words are unfamiliar. 
`p`

`p.
There is perhaps a meta-methodological shift in perspective 
involved here: we can place theoretical emphasis 
and the force of causation more on the abstract-system 
side or the cognitive side of such analysis.  
We can, on the one hand, argue that English 
speakers are `q.disposed` to predict the grammaticality of 
`AdjN; only, or precisely, because the 
`AdjN; to predicate-subject reduction is a rule of 
English.  It is not as if `AdjN; acceptability in 
a given novel context is in doubt, and English 
users have to speculate whether or not the community 
will decide one way or another %-- by comparison to 
how it `i.is` an open question whether a neologism 
or novel idiomatic usage `i.will` `q.catch on`/.  
Linguists might well say that neologistic 
and idiomatic entrenchment `i.is` a properly cognitive 
phenomenon because, prior to entrenchment, these usages are 
not fixed mandates of the language system, so speakers 
have to anticipate other speakers' comportment 
to them %-- a kind of `q.theory of other minds` which 
is of course irreducibly cognitive.  But the predictability 
of legitimating `AdjN; is not cognitive in the same 
way, because `AdjN; is abstractly essential to the language 
system.  We do not `q.think about` `AdjN; in the sense 
of weighing or debating it; instead it is an 
`i.objdct of thought` in the passive sense that 
`AdjN; is a grammatical rule which we can think about, 
and use as a maxim, but something whose objective 
status is outside our control. 
`p`

`p.
In the more `q.objective` perspective I just spoke to, 
essential linguistic rules and constructions are 
`i.passive` objects of thought in that our proper 
disposition to them is to take them as objective 
givens, which we can think about, and incorporate into 
our arsenal of techniques prerequiste for linguistic 
competence, but we do not actively shape them.  
No one person %-- or even entire linguistic community %-- 
can decide that a novel `AdjN; construction is 
`i.not` a template for a predicate-subject predication.  
Language, then, encompasses rules for mapping 
syntactic and semantic constructions to predicate 
structures, and such rules are objects of thought only 
in this passive sense %-- which is why (on such account) 
cognition is theoretically tangential to linguistic analysis, 
just as analysis of the structural integrity of the Eiffel Tower 
should not reference my personal experiences of the Eiffel Tower 
qua object of thought.  
`p`

`p.
In the `AdjN; case, the inevitability of constructional 
validity is `i.passive` because we assume language users 
exercise no active agency in assenting to the `AdjN; 
rule.  That is, the `q.objective` perspective is plausible 
because it seems that `AdjN; is so broad and fundamental as 
to be outside the realm of active engagement on 
speakers' part.  This analysis, then, is only persuasive 
to the degree that we do indeed relegate the speaker's 
role to one of a passive observer.  While in broad outlines 
this conception may be defensible, the argument becomes 
increasingly strained as we consider specific cases 
of predicate-bearer relationships.  The minimal logical 
notion of `i.some generic` substrate bearing 
`i.some generic` predicate actually encompasses many 
kinds of cases.  We can consider variations of instantiation 
modes: a `i.black/tabby/hungry/stray/prize-winning/adopted/very black/very hungry` 
cat.  The `i.black` predicate differs from `i.hungry` in our 
anticipation that the cat is `i.always` black, but only 
`i.sometimes` hungry.  Moreover, `i.black` refers to how 
the cat appears, whereas `i.hungry` refers more to how 
the cat `i.feels`/, and designates a biological phenomenon; 
a `i.rock` or `i.dress` can be black, but not hungry.  
Unlike `q.black`/, `i.tabby` is a categorization of 
cats as much as a designation of how they appear.  
Therefore `i.very tabby` is quite dubious, while even 
`i.very black` is questionable (since there is 
no obvious scale of more or less blackness), 
but `i.very hungry` is quite reasonable.  Meanwhile, 
`i.stray`/, `i.prize-winning`/, and `i.adopted` 
are all contextual predicates concerning cats in relation 
to humans, so they are not `q.borne` by cats in 
the material sense of an object bearing a color, 
or the biological sense of an animal bearing hunger.   
`p`

`p.
Alongside these predicative variations, we should also 
recognize the proliferation of distinct 
ontological `q.registers` through which 
predicate-subject relations can be conceptualized.
We have a `i.registered democrat`/, an `i.Iowa causus`/, 
a `i.primary season`/, an `i.illegal goal`/, a `i.championship match`/, 
a `i.televised game`/, a `i.winning touchdown`/, 
a `i.controversial call`/, 
a `i.video review`/, a `i.porcelain cat`/, 
a `i.police dog`/, a `i.barking dog`/.  
The full spectrum of material, biological, psychological, 
or sociocultural `q.objects` that can be predicative 
subjects; and the range of concrete or abstract 
properties that they can all instantiate %-- against 
this diversity the vague predicate-subject pairing seems 
so underspecified as to be almost theoretically beside 
the point.  In point of fact, while we recognize a 
minimal `AdjN; pairing as `q.grammatical` in a 
vague schematic sense, we do not consider most 
such formulations as communicatively well-founded: |+|
 
`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  That's a hungry window overlooking the yard. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  That's a porcelain touchdown under video review. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Superficially the problem with these sentences is 
semantic, in the sense that other sentences with 
apparently the same form, but different lexical 
selection, are fine: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  That's a stained-glass window overlooking the yard. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  That's a porcelain vase under fluorescent lights. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Of course, just because any random `AdjN; combination is 
grammatically plausible, we cannot expect that any 
noun will have a meaningful predicative combination with 
any subject. 
`p`

`p.
Nevertheless, these assessments do not only occur at 
the individual lexical level.  For instance, 
`i.hungry` is reasonably paired with any sentient 
animal, so in fact there `i.is` a general pattern here: 
in lieu of `AdjN; we have a productive rule 
like `HungrySentient;.  Langacker calls this 
a `i.partial elaboration`/: the pattern `HungrySentient;
is more specific than (and a narrowing of) `AdjN;, but 
more general than `i.hungry cat`/.  
So we do not just have the extremely general and underspecified 
`AdjN; pattern, along with individual lexical instantiations 
of this pattern, which may or may not make sense for lexical 
reasons.  We have intermediate patterns like 
`HungrySentient;, which are somewhere in between.  Are these 
patterns syntactic or semantic?  Do we take `q.sentient noun` 
as a class of nouns %-- so a kind of more specific  
grammatical category %-- or as a grouping of lexical entries 
which share some important feature?     
`p`

`p.
In light of this question, consider the issue of 
predictability: assuming that the noun designates 
a sentient creature, we anticipate that 
`HungrySentient; will always be well-formed not 
just in the minimal sense of being grammatically 
unproblemmatic, but in the more important sense 
of being conceptually tractable.  This seems analogous 
to the `AdjN; case: the pattern is a global rule 
of language because it automatically propagates to 
new contexts.  Likewise, it seems that any English 
speaker would consent that any sentient animal 
%-- even one she has has never encountered before, 
or even a newly-discovered species or a newly-invented 
fictional creature %-- is a reasonable vehicle 
for the `HungrySentient; pattern.  This pattern 
thereby seems `q.grammatical` in the productional 
sense that it licences new construction-instances, 
as opposed to these being established as lexical 
particulars.  Note by comparison that some 
patterns seem more determined by lexical 
specifics, e.g. `i.quick car`/, `i.quick question`/, 
`i.quick bite`/, `i.quick score`/.  There are different 
senses in which something can be quick, so one might 
argue that how the `i.quick` predicate modifies a 
given noun is a lexical detail that has to be worked 
out on a case-by-case basis.  But, excepting 
obviously metaphorical uses, `i.hungry` always 
specifically refers to animals capable of 
experiencing their need for food.  
`p`

`p.
In short, the predictability of `HungrySentient; being 
deemed coherent, in the presence of a sentient 
noun, seems structurally analogous (even if 
more grounded in concrete signification) than the 
`AdjN; pattern.  However, `HungrySentient; also 
appears more difficult to abstract away as a 
fixed pattern of language which we only passively 
internalize, in the course of our mastering linguistic 
rules.  For one thing, we readily extend the 
pattern in more rhetorical or metaphorical ways, 
on certain occasions: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  This team is hungry for a win. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The violent protesters are hungry for revenge. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Most voters are hungry for a change. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

These somewhat-metaphorical cases are examples of 
`q.blending`/, where some facets of the core meaning 
%-- the sentience of the agent which bears hunger, and 
the status of hunger as experientializing a biological 
need %-- are transferred to novel contexts.  
The parameter of `i.sentience` is preserved, although 
perhaps indirectly insofar as the discourse talks 
about a group of people, not individuals (`i.a team`/, `i.most voters`/).  
Moreover, the object of want is not food, but something 
less concrete.  However, we accept these patterns as 
acceptable extensions of the `HungrySentient; template 
because the blends `q.work`/; they are conceptually coherent.  
`p`

`p.
Meanwhile, a further complication is the 
intermixture of different extensions from a core 
pattern.  We readily extend `i.cat` to encompass 
representations or fictitious entities: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The porcelain cat is black. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Garfield is a talking cat in a comic strip. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  In the musical, all the actors are cats. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

But we cannot mix this extension with the `i.hungry` 
construction, in many cases: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The porcelain cat is hungry. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  Garfield ate my breakfact. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  All the cats are hungry because the actors don't eat 
before the show starts. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|
 
In short, a pattern like `HungrySentient;, 
or more generally `q.`AdjSentient;`/, say %-- 
some predicate of a sentient animal 
%-- can be extended out in multiple directions.  
Hunger can be replaced by a less somatic 
desire, which it metaphorically connotes; 
the word for an animal can be re-used in 
the sense of a depiction or simulation 
(a sculpture, image, fiction, or impersonation).  
These lines of extension provide extensions 
of constructive patterns, but they do not 
necessarily work together.  It may well 
be that the acceptance of a complex or 
imaginative extension to a constructive 
pattern `i.does` involve active consideration 
on speakers' part, rather than just passive 
acceptance of the usage as an objective 
feature of language.  Speakers, in particular, 
can decide whether an unexpected usage is 
a comprehensible `q.conceptual blend` that 
fits some prior extensional pattern, 
or whether it is an idiosyncratic usage 
that may be understandable, but not 
sufficiently warranted by existing convention to 
be repeated or casually acknowledged.
`p`

`p.
As a concrete example, the `HungrySentient; 
pattern is often extended to the `q.non-somatic` 
desires of `i.groups` of people.  This 
more complex extension is actually more prevalent 
than more unidimensional blends: I think 
(`ref<itm:fan>;) is more conventional than (`ref<itm:fans>;): |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:fans ->  The fans are hungry for a goal. -> ont ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:fan ->  That fan is hungry for a goal. -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Also we are `i.less` likely to adopt `i.hungry` for 
other more `q.somatic` sensations, which involve less 
metaphorical leap: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  I am hungry for some sleep. -> ont ;; 
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- ->  The dogs are hungry for water.  -> ont ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|
 
Perhaps these more mundane constructions are less normal-sounding 
because they conflict with non-metaphorical alternatives 
(like `i.thirsty`/); to truly warrant a metaphorical usage 
a pattern may need to coalesce several different 
variations on the underlying pattern %-- e.g. shifting 
`i.hunger` toward desire for a more abstract substance `i.and` 
switching from an individual to a collective.  Or perhaps 
cases like `i.fans hungry for a goal` became entrenched so 
that other uses which seem to involve the same `i.kind` 
of blend or extension feel more conventional.  
A construction like (`ref<itm:fan>;) may then be registered as 
understandable, but with a certain mental note that 
the speaker here is `i.not` adopting a kind of 
extension which agrees with other precedents (in contrast 
to (`ref<itm:fans>;)).  This impression would render the hearer 
of (`ref<itm:fan>;) less likely to use extensions with the same 
premise in turn.   
`p`

`p.
In these cases addressees are not passively 
accepting novel constructions as mechanical 
inevitabilities, but are, instead, actively 
weighing the plausibility and conventionality 
of the construction to establish both 
the semantic intent of the conceptual blend 
and how it accords with linguistic precedent.  
These judgments are matters of degree, and 
it is entirely possible that the language 
community's collective decision to incorporate 
some potential construction into `q.normal` 
usage is impossible to predict `i.a priori`/.  
In short, whether or not a given construction 
becomes conventionalized  
%-- at least insofar as it metaphorically 
deviates from while building off of some core pattern like 
`HungrySentient; %-- cannot be regarded 
as an objective fact of language which users 
just passively cognize.   
`p`

`p.
Arguably, now, such observations 
can be accommodated by simply 
separating out metaphorical uses as semiotically 
complex, and therefore potentially interesting 
but thematically removed from the core concerns 
of linguistics proper.  Even if we grant 
that active cognitive engagement is needed to 
interpret and assent to metaphorical discourse, 
we can coherently argue that there are plenty 
of `i.non-`/metaphorical uses, and that 
the core of linguistic analysis lies with such 
cases, so that metaphor and other rhetorical 
or discourse-related parameters of linguistic 
performance can be broached by supplemental 
analyses %-- perhaps semiotic or discourse-theoretic 
rather than linguistic proper %-- adjunct 
to the core linguistic analysis.  This possibility 
is plausible insofar as we can demarcate a 
realm of construction-instantiations which are 
`i.not` metaphorical; so let us try to 
specify what the properties of discourse 
`i.without` any metaphor, or any 
conceptual blending, might entail.
`p`

`p.
Given a fully abstract schema like `AdjN;, 
we can only `i.passively` accept that 
such constructions are grammatical and that 
they signify predicate-subject predications.  
But now we also want to stipulate that 
the pattern is instantiated `i.non-metaphorically`/, 
which means that the specific manner in which 
the predicate applies to the subject has to be 
somehow `i.objective` or matter-of-fact, 
not involving any interpretive effort or 
cognitive assent.  So `i.hungry cat` is 
properly non-metaphorical because we have a clear 
biological notion of a cat being hungry, 
but `q.hungry voters` `i.is` metaphorical and 
therefore has to be, in effect, assigned to a different 
order of communications.  Similarly, 
`i.black cat` is non-metaphorical because 
it fits an objective predicational pattern 
%-- a spatial object predicated with a 
color term, implying that its visible 
surface is composed of a material bearing that color.  
Here `i.black cat` instantiates a pattern we 
could notate as, say, `ColorObject;, which is 
non-metaphorical so long as the object is a 
normal-sized material thing whose color we can 
observe (whereas `i.blue Earth` or 
`i.green energy` or `i.black Tuesday` are metaphorical 
to varying degrees). 
`p`

`p.
If we simply say that syntactic patterns like 
`AdjN; belong solely to grammar %-- that 
their acceptability in a given case is wholly 
a matter of lexical particulars %-- then we 
are not really progressing toward a theory of 
a linguistic core which is cognitive only in a 
passive sense.  After all, active interpretation 
may be needed to assess whether a concrete 
instantiation of `AdjN; is plausible %-- which 
would seem to render this judgment intrinsically 
(and not just passively) cognitive.  
I think those whose intuitions point away 
from an essentially (and `i.actively`/) 
cognitive role in language-understand would 
implicitly look beyond the vague `AdjN; 
prototype, and instead point out that 
certain predicate-subject instantiations 
are objective phenomena, or kinds of 
phenomena, which we `i.emprically speaking` 
passively cognize.  In the 
`ColorObject; schema, for instance, 
we need not actively interpret 
the predication in the canonical 
(and non-metaphorical) case of the 
surface color visible on some ordinary-sized 
physical object.  Given any color-term 
we therefore inherit, into language, a 
predicate construction siting the color into 
objects, and when encountering such 
constructions (like `i.red apple` or 
`i.green can`/) we merely passively read 
the linguistic construction as signifying the 
mundane predication.
`p`

`p.
So the burden of analysis for a `q.non-metaphorical` 
linguistic `q.core` actually depends not on 
unspecified generalizations like `AdjN;, but 
rather on certain narrowings of such constructions 
which can be given non-metaphorical interpretations.  
From `AdjN; we can derive more specific 
constructions like `ColorObject; or 
`HungrySentient;.  We can then say that these 
narrower constructions have non-metaphorical 
instantiations (setting aside metaphorical extensions), 
and that `i.in the presence` of these non-metaphorical 
cases the role of cognition is wholly passive.  
Insofar as it is passive, we can then say that 
cognition need not be theoretically thematized, 
and argue that the constructions occupy cognition 
in a manner that, given cognitive passivity, 
allows us to relegate cognition to a purely 
observational role, so that we analyze the 
constructions as objects `i.of` cognition rather than 
structures created `i.by` cognition; we endow them 
with a certain extramental objectivity. 
`p`

`p.
Here I will not dispute that language `i.sometimes` has 
this degree of propositional transparency such that 
cognition is `q.passive` to the point of being 
scientifically eliminable.  However, I will point out 
that these cases involve very specific configurations 
both at the empirical and the linguistic level.  
The glosses `ColorObject; and `HungrySentient; can 
be seen as both templates for linguistic content 
and prototypes of situations expressed in language.  
These are cases where we have a straightforward 
and rather naturalistic construal of how a predicate 
inheres in a subject %-- color in a physical object, say 
%-- and moreover we have a middle-abstract construction 
which can be elaborated in non-metaphorical ways.  
By `q.middle-abstract` I mean that we are dealing with 
word-classes broader than lexemes but narrower than 
grammatical categories (e.g., the class of words 
designating sentient animals).  A fully-generic 
pattern like `AdjN; then becomes partly-narrowed 
into constructions like `ColorObject; or `HungrySentient;, 
`i.then` these intermediate constructions get 
finally elaborated in a manner that supplies lexical 
specificity in a pedestrian manner: the `i.sentient animal` 
slot gets filled by designation of an actual 
sentient animal (not a figurine or a sports team), 
or the colored-object slot filled by an actual 
mid-sized object.  Under these specific circumstances, 
we can talk of cognition having a mostly passive 
linguistic role.  
`p`

`p.
However, laying out all the preconditions for this 
passivity points to a rejoinder, for those committed 
to the centrality of cognition: it is not obvious 
that this particular constellation of linguistic 
and empirical content, where predication and 
middle-abstract linguistic constructions align 
in just the right ways to permit purely non-metaphorical 
predictability, is somehow the most important or 
most characteristic example of how language relates to 
states of affairs.  From the fact that cognition is 
plausibly passive in `i.some` language artifacts,  
we cannot generalize to say that linguistic 
analysis should focus on these cases at the 
expense of, or even as preliminary to, others.   
`p`


`subsection.Contextuality and Compositionality`
`p.
Above I suggested that paradigms which try 
to minimize the thematic role of cognition in linguistic 
analysis face several problems.  My preceding 
argumentation has focused on the idea of 
`q.predictability`/: how constructions licence 
novel elaborations, which at the cognitive 
level points to language users' active role in 
assessing or expecting the legitimacy of 
newly created expressions.  Plus, I just 
conceded that sometimes we `i.can` grant 
a passive role to cognition here too: 
at least sometimes, constructions find 
new elaborations which are both sufficiently 
grounded to existing patterns on the linguistic 
side, and communicative of sufficiently 
`q.objective` states of affairs on the empirical 
side, that we are compelled to passively 
accept the construction-instance as unequivocally 
signifying some predicate structure.  However, 
I cautioned that these cases may be the 
exception to the norm, rather than vice-versa.   
`p`

`p.
The problem of `i.contextuality` is manifest in 
how discourse is open-ended: `i.the dogs are barking` 
or `i.those dogs are thirsty` are only meaningful 
if all conversants have, from 
context, a clear notion of which dogs are 
`i.the dogs` or `i.those dogs`/.  We can 
be more precise via, say, `i.the dogs in that yard`/, 
but this still has deitic open-endedness.  
Any transparent propositional context emerges 
only via substituting determinate content for 
any designations which conversants have to 
infer from the dialogic situation 
(something like `i.the dogs in the yard 
directly in front of the person speaking`/, 
but for all its specificity such langauge 
sounds strage `i.as` human language).

`p.
How linguistic entities are mapped to ambient 
objects and situations is presumably outside 
of language proper: no-one should claim that 
passively obeying linguistic rules 
enables one to transition from 
`i.those dogs` to `i.the dogs in the yard directly in front 
of the person speaking`/.  The most 
plausible hypothesis seems to be that deitic 
reference, resolution of pronoun antecedents, 
and similar localized referential context-sensitivity 
demands a mixture of linguistic and extra-linguistic 
reason, often demanding active reasoning; an intersubjective 
faculty for inferring speaker intent.  I would 
guess that most linguists could accept that hypothesis, 
even if they are otherwise committed to reducing the 
role of `q.active` cognition. 
`p`

`p.
In some contexts, deictic or antecedent reference can 
indeed be separated out from syntactic or semantic 
reasoning as a distinct phase or dimension of 
linguistic processing.  So a pronoun like 
`i.she` might need to be mentally substituted by 
`i.Warren`/, or more precisely by `i.Senator Elizabeth Warren`/.
We can analyze linguistic processing as a mostly passive 
observation of syntactic and semantic rules `i.after` 
all such `q.local` substitutions occur.  Going 
further, we can also consider `q.holistic` substitutions, 
where one sentence is inferred when another is spoken, 
like `i.I would like you to pass me the kimchee` for 
`i.Could you pass me the kimchee`/?  In these latter cases 
addressees infer the original speaker's propositional 
content by `i.global` substitutions of one enunciation 
for another (unspoken) one; in the former, the 
propositional content is established by locally 
substituting context-specific words and references 
for their empicial equivalents.  
`p`

`p.
If someone asserts, say, that `i.Warren is in Minnesota`/, 
this sentence's propositional content would be more 
expansively described as `i.Senator Elizabeth Warren` 
being physically situated (at the time of enunciation) 
in the `i.state of Minnesota`/, a geographic region.  
Nothing in this content depends on the senator being 
named as `i.Warren`/, `i.Elizabeth Warren`/, or 
anything else.  Context may of course dictate how much 
precision is warranted for communicative transparency: 
a cable news show discussion the American presidential 
hopefuls might use just `i.Warren`/, while a Minneapolis 
newspaper, covering many topics (and therefore without 
the campaign as a referential filter), might prefer 
`i.Elizabeth Warren` in a headline.  International 
papers could go further toward, say, 
`i.Elizabeth Warren, presidential candidate`/.  
But none of these variations affect the 
relevant sentences' propositional content; instead 
they model different conversants' familiarity with 
the person and therefore their predisposition to 
understand `i.Warren` as `i.Senator Elizabeth Warren`/.     
All of these referential options have the same referent, 
even if not every English speaker would parse the 
reference completely: by analogy, someone 
who sees Elizabeth Warren on television would 
be seeing `i.Senator Elizabeth Warren`/, even if 
they do not know who she is.  
`p` 

`p.
If the meaning of `i.Warren is in Minnesota` is 
that `i.Senator Elizabeth Warren is in the 
state of Minnesota`/, then variations on how 
we cite her name are not consequential for 
the meaning itself; as a result, we might 
argue, they are not foregrounded 
in semantic analysis of that meaning.  Someone 
who says the pithier sentence, and then 
(on a signal she's misunderstood) the more specific 
one, is not presenting two different states of affairs, 
but merely repackaging the initial content in a 
suface structure better targeted to her listener's 
state of knowledge (or understanding of the current 
dialog context).  We can pragmatically choose 
our words for hearers' benefit (or to ensure 
hearers take no offence, as in implicatures).  
This is, arguably, possible `i.because` the 
same propositional content may be expressed 
via different specific sentences; therefore, we 
may mentally scan through different phraseological 
options to find a choice for the exact sentence 
we produce which is dialogically most 
cooperative: maximizing the likelihood of being 
understood and also (as seen in `q.polite` speech) 
treating conversation as a rational exchange, 
not an occasion for bullying or power displays. 
`p`

`p.
We can certainly claim that the choice of one 
specific sentence, out of many options that 
express `i.the same propositional content`/, 
is cognitively `q.active`/.  However, this 
supposition also ackowledges that there 
is a propositional content that may be shared 
among superficially different sentences.  The 
issues raised here are in a sense the inverse of 
those addressed through Langacker's `i.cat on the mat` 
example: just as one surface sentence can designate 
variegated propositions in divergent contexts, 
variegated sentences can all encode one sole state of 
affairs.  Hence 
we are agreeing on a kind of equivalence class 
among sentences, perhaps reflecting equivalence classes 
among their components: `i.Warren`/, 
`i.Elizabeth Warren`/, and `i.Senator Elizabeth Warren` 
being interchangeable in the proper context.  
So while we may actively decide how to 
render the relevant predicate structure 
in context-appropriate English, we simultaneously 
work within the acknowledgement that there is a 
specific propositional content at play whose 
linguistic encoding follows conventional rules 
(which we can only passively cognize).   
`p`

`p.
Referring back to the idea of constructional 
patterns, `i.Warren is in Minnesota` can be
seen as an instantiation of a pattern 
like `NounIsInPlace;, whose implied predicate 
structure is that some physical object (expressed by 
the noun) is physically located in the expanse 
of the place (construed as an extended region).  
This pattern is an intermediate level of 
construction that can be filled in to varying 
degrees of referential detail.  So we may actively 
decide whether `i.Warren`/, `i.Elizabeth Warren`/, or 
`i.Senator Elizabeth Warren` is the most context-appropriate 
way of stating her name; but we passively acknowledge 
that once the nominal and locative references 
are established, the `NounIsInPlace; construction 
systematically signifies an objective 
state of affairs, involving the object's spatial location.  
`p`

`p.
Context is a `q.problem` for those who want to 
de-emphasize linguistic cognition because there seems 
to be active cognitive labor involved in choosing 
which specific elaboration %-- given an intermediate 
schema like `NounIsInPlace; %-- is most 
contextually appropriate.  Moreover, speakers implicitly 
anticipate how other speakers will frame the current 
context, and use this interpersonal knowledge 
to guide their choice of context-specific linguistic 
content %-- e.g., referential expressions %-- preferring 
expressions which are concise but unambiguous.  
But this cognitive activity only exists in the space 
created by a gap between schemas such as `NounIsInPlace; 
and actual expressions: the context `q.problem` can, 
potentially, be resolved by observing that 
`i.active` cognition is only implicated by the 
range of choices for how intermediate schema may be 
concretized, given the substitutability of 
expressions like `i.Warren` and `i.Elizabeth Warren`/.
We can then claim that the surface realization of 
the schema is a pragmatic matter, and maybe cognitively 
subtle, but that the weight of syntax and 
`i.semantics` lies with the intermediate construction, 
which can be completed in different ways for 
equivalent propositional content. 
`p`

`p.
Here again, the weight of this analysis apparently lies 
with the intermediate schema: patterns like 
`NounIsInPlace;, `HungrySentient;, or 
`ColorObject; are sufficiently transparent 
%-- in terms of how linguistic constituents encode 
predicate structures and their participants 
%-- that we can more or less passively 
apply them to objective situations.  
We passively internalize the principle that 
certain constructions are how we express certain 
situations %-- exercising discretion perhaps 
in the precise referential terms used, but less so 
in the constructions themselves %-- 
and likewise passively parse the instantiation 
of these patterns as encodings of their 
propositional content.  We passively observe, 
for instance, that `NounIsInPlace; is a kind 
of reified exemplar for asserting spatial 
claims pertaining to objects, and passively 
exercise the linguistic machinery that 
comes into effect once the referential 
constituents like `i.Warren` and `i.Minnesota` 
have been decided.  
`p`

`p.
Such cognitive `i.passivity`/, in turn, supports a 
paradigm wherein cognition does not warrant 
focal theoretical attention, because cognition does 
not have an active, structuring, causal role.  
It may indeed be that a nontrivial portion of linguistic 
processing involves cognition more actively or 
interpretively, but we can still isolate a 
semantic core %-- rooted in constructions that 
unsubtly embody predicate constructions %-- 
where cognition operates passively and mechanically, 
so that analysis can focus on the predicate-signifying 
structures we have cognition `i.of`/.  The gambit of 
a `q.non-cognitive` linguistics would be to claim that 
syntax and semantics proper may be focused on this 
propositionally transparent core, and that other 
facets of linguistic performance %-- the reasoning in 
substutions among competing realizations of a propositional 
content; the formation and interpretation of rhetorically 
more complex sentences which do not employ logically 
simplistic construction patterns %-- can be 
approached as supplements to the core analysis, 
yielding two modes of analysis which can be theoretically 
partitioned.
`p`

`p.
I believe the essential weakness of this metatheoretical 
setup is that it rests on, or perhaps extrapolates from, 
a specific genre of linguistic constructions; furthermore 
a specific version of the transitions mapping back and 
forth between propositional content and surface structure.  
There are (as I have put it) `q.logically transparent` 
construction-patterns which encode predicate 
structures more or less mechanically, and which in turn 
can generate diverse surface language (via referential 
substitution, or perhaps `q.holistic` substitution 
at the sentence level, e.g. within implicature).  
Analysis can posit a neat separation of pragmatics 
from syntax and semantics %-- and a de-emphasis 
of active cognition from the latter two %-- 
for linguistic productions which shoehorn 
propositional content-expression through this 
`i.sort` of workflow, and the particular style 
among the `q.middle-abstract` constructions 
which enables encodings of this kind.  
However, while a `q.propositionally transparent` 
style does exist in language and does need 
to be accounted for by a comprehensive 
theory, we should balk at assuming these 
cases are protypical or explanatorily privileged.   
`p`

`p.
If we analyze the relations between propositional contents 
and the linguistic constructions that carry them, we 
do not only find conventionalized renderings of 
predicate structure, such as my running examples 
(`NounIsInPlace;, `HungrySentient;, 
and `ColorObject;).  In many cases, predicate structure 
is conveyed through more elaborate constructions 
with their own compositional patterns, deviating from 
a transparent reciprocation of the underlying logical 
form.  I'll examine two hypothetical sentences as examples: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> bidensupport ->  Biden's support among his base is eroding. -> fig ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> clashes ->  Violent clashes between protesters and the 
police have spilled out into the streets. -> fig ;;  
`sentenceList`

|.|

One interesting feature of (`ref<clashes>;) is that `i.the streets` 
figures in the second clause as if to contrast 
with the first clause; but normally we expect 
`q.protests` to happen `i.in` the streets 
in turn (this is a different situation than, say, 
`i.passengers leaving the subway station spilled out 
onto the street`/).  Evidently, then, `i.the streets` 
has two different conceptual interpretations which are 
both relevant to how we would probably receive 
(`ref<clashes>;) (in the typical kind of context where 
(`ref<clashes>;) would be spoken or written).
`p`

`p.
If we say `i.violence has spilled out into the streets`/, 
the implication is that the violence designated is 
random and chaotic.  This implies that whoever formulates 
(`ref<clashes>;) would be thinking of violent acts like assault or 
vandalism (not just confrontational acts directed 
at authorities in the course of political protest).  
In (`ref<clashes>;) we thereby have an 
implicit contrast figured between two different forms
of violence; a goal-directed defiance which is 
specific to aggressive confrontations between protestors 
and police officers (or other representatives of governmental 
authority), as compared with a less `q.ideological` 
form of violence, where intimidation or property destruction 
is pursued for its own sake.  The speaker appears to 
be claiming the the more `q.constrained` or 
`q.structured` aggression in the former sense has 
transitioned to the more chaotic scenario of the latter.  
`p`

`p.
This reading is context-dependent: we can imagine 
scenarios where, let's say, protests originated 
in some government building and over several hours 
expanded outside.  In that case (`ref<clashes>;)'s `i.into the streets` 
would be more of a literal profiling of a spatial 
path.  However, I feel that a more likely 
use case for (`ref<clashes>;) would involve the trajectory 
being more metaphorical: the violence has 
`q.moved` in a rather abstract space of  
categorizations or interpretations of the violence; 
violence as a consequence of defiant protests 
vs. violence as the medium or riotous or destructive 
behavior.
`p`

`p.
Having said that, (`ref<clashes>;)'s `i.into the streets` formulation 
does also have less metaphorical aspects, because 
a further implication (in this `q.riotous` scenario) is 
that the episodes of violence are indeed spatially 
expanding.  A protest, even a violent one, tends to 
be spatially circumscribed; the transition from a 
protest to a `i.riot`/, or some other more 
chaotic development, is marked in part by the 
participating indivuals being less constrained 
by a specific focal location.  Someone would be 
more likely to characterize protests as a 
`i.riot` if they witnessed (or learned of indirectly) 
incidents that seemed spatially random and spread 
out; one would less likely employ that concept 
for spatially structured protests concentrated in 
one geographic location, even if the protesters were 
acting violently.  Implicitly, then, 
the conceptual shift involved in construing 
defiant acts as a `i.protest` or a `i.riot` is 
driven in part by our conception 
of the spatial (or `q.urban-geographical`/) environment 
where the events unfold.
`p`

`p.
So the comparison between (`ref<clashes>;)'s two `q.poles of focus`/, 
on my reading, is spatial on two levels, one more 
literal and one more metaphorical.  These two construals 
are mutually reinforcing.  The speaker is presenting an 
overall construal which has several dimensions, including the 
idea that (as I outlined it) there is a transition in 
`q.kind of violence` appertaining to some protest or 
sequence of protests.  One observational `i.warrant` for this 
construal comes the `q.spatial patterns` of riotous 
incidents, so that the spatial figuration in 
`i.spill out into the streets` in part denotes 
the pattern of observations which compels the speaker 
to frame the situation as (`ref<clashes>;) implies.  Meanwhile, 
(`ref<clashes>;) also intimates that the more chaotic 
situation is both a consequence of and a deviation 
from the state denoted at (`ref<clashes>;)'s opening.  
To use the phrase `i.spill out` implies some 
breach in a container, some outward-aiming force 
that disrupts a more structured scenario into a 
less structured one.  Parsing `i.spill out`/, then, 
we are led to `i.violent protests` being 
construed as (albeit violent) somewhat contained 
%-- which then invokes the sense of `i.protests` 
as implying a geographically focused gathering.  
`p`

`p.
The implication, then, is that the very fact 
of the confrontation being `i.protests` %-- i.e., 
that the protesters were self-conscious of 
`i.protesting` and therefore adhered to a certain 
ordered script %-- acted as a container, 
which constrained the protesters both 
spatially and behaviorally.  The phrase 
`i.spilled out` implies that the restraints 
connoted in the first part of (`ref<clashes>;) are broken, 
and that this in turn is manifest both 
spatially and behaviorally: the violent incidents 
are more spatially scattered and also, we infer, 
less regulated by the conventions of `q.protesting`/.  
The manner in which (`ref<clashes>;) is constructed 
implies that the speaker is asserting some psychological 
shift on the part of the protesters %-- that 
they have ceased to deem themselves bound to 
respect certain limits (out of a desire to avoid 
being punished, or to garner public sympathy, or 
a desire not to cause harm) that would ordinarily 
be in effect insofar as one intends to `i.protest` 
and take part in a protest.

`p.
I think there may also be an implied assertion of 
`i.why` this psychological shift has occurred.  
It may be that `q.violently clashing` with the police 
undermines their authority %-- e.g., by normalizing 
acts of insubordination, or disrupting their ability 
to exercise control as normal %-- which in turn has 
emboldened people to commit acts they would normally 
shy away from.  Noting that the phraseology 
suggests a relatively extended transitional 
process %-- `i.have spilled out` in the perfect tense 
%-- we can also speculate that the protesters 
grew less disciplined as the protests dragged on, 
perhaps out of frustration.  Of course, the point 
is not to guess as to empirical facts but to 
infer the speaker's rationale for her choice 
of words %-- how should we read the use of 
a perfective rather than simple past rendering 
in `i.have spilled out`/?  And why that choice 
of spatial figuration rather than a more 
straighforward path-designation like 
`q.moved`/?   
`p`

`p.
Since speakers consciously or unconsciously select 
one phraseology in preference to others, we can 
always (and instinctively tend to) read their 
choice as signaling their specific stance toward 
the signified situation, whether or not this 
signaling is deliberate.  The choice of 
surface-rendering is not only a choice 
of `i.what` to describe, but of `i.how to frame` 
a description: constructional choices indicate 
the speaker's `i.interpretation` and 
`i.assessment` of the situation.  In many aspects 
we can highlight the aspects in which this 
framing is `i.epistemic`/: for (`ref<clashes>;) I have noted 
rhetorical dimensions which connotes 
warrants for (`ref<clashes>;)'s perspective (observations 
of a spatial patterns suggesting that the 
protests are becoming more disorganized) and 
causal interpretations (the protesters' psychological 
shift, the authorities losing legitimacy).  
We tend (inevitably, I would argue) to read 
sentences like (`ref<clashes>;) as not merely describing 
some situation %-- not merely presenting 
their propositional content as descriptive 
assemblies %-- but as packaging up an 
epistemic `i.account` of the situation.  
The `i.epistemics` of linguistic constructions 
include how the choice of surface-level forms 
connote speakers' rational attitudes 
toward situations %-- interpretations and causal 
assessments of, explanations and 
warrants for, and so forth.   
`p`

`p.
One facet of this connotation, in (`ref<clashes>;), lies with 
`i.spilled out` being a metaphor; but we should 
not get sidetracked into interpreting the 
operation of this construction being 
especially imagistic or ad-hoc.  Instead, 
we should read the metaphor as conveniently 
packaging multiple epistemic dimensions.  
The spatial aspect of `i.spilled out` helps 
signify the `q.evidential` dimension to 
(`ref<clashes>;)'s reasoning, since a spatial pattern of 
observables constitutes one of (`ref<clashes>;)'s warrants.  
The force-dynamic aspect helps profile 
the apparent construal of a psychological 
shift (among the protesters), which 
supports (`ref<clashes>;)'s apparent causal interpretation 
(that the sentence describes a non-ordinary 
level of violence caused by earlier protests 
along with some breakdown in the conventions 
which might otherwise prevent protests from 
becoming too anarchic).  In short, 
`i.has spilled out` hooks in multifaceted 
epistemic intimations in just a few 
words, so it is reasonable that a speaker 
might gravitate to that phraseology 
when choosing, however deliberately or 
subconsciously, the precise verbiage 
with which to formulate her observations.  
I would argue that we instinctively 
tend to select the formulations which 
carry the most epistemic content 
%-- which signify interpretations, causal theories, 
connotations of evidence, etc., alongside 
bare descriptions %-- because these 
most organically encapsulate how we 
mentally comport to situations.  
`p` 

`p.
On this theory, speakers gravitate to metaphoric 
patterns not so much because `q.figurative` usages 
(being imagistic or somehow pictorial, and 
therefore in a sense iconifying rather 
than abstractly describing relationships) 
are convenient proxies for complex elaborations.  
Instead, metaphors can unify multiple 
epistemic dimensions, and so we subconsciously 
may find a given metaphorical expression the most 
natural `q.fit` for our own understanding.  
If we imagine ourselves subconsciously scanning 
the space of surface-realizations to linguistically 
encode a situation, it is plausible that we 
are disposed to select the formation which 
matches our internal construal most exactly, 
and moreover that `i.most exactly` often means 
`i.according to the greatest number of epistemic dimensions`/.  
We may subconsciously choose a given metaphor 
because it has multi-dimensional epistemic 
appropriateness `visavis; our own construals, 
making it `i.feel` most accurate, compared to 
either (more or less metaphoric) alternatives.  
`p`

`p.
I'll illustrate this thesis with (`ref<bidensupport>;) from earlier: 
the metaphor of `i.Biden's base eroding` 
encompasses a range of spatial, temporal, and 
force-dynamic facets.  First, erosion is 
understood to be a gradual but progressive change.  
Second, it implies that some object or substance 
(in literal use, a geographic feature) is diminishing 
in spatial extent.  Third, `i.erosion` implies a 
contrast of interior and exterior forces, where 
external forces somehow overpower contraindicating 
tendencies for the eroding feature to remain whole.  
In a political context, a `i.base` has an internal 
dynamic which tends to keep it intact, because 
people's ideological commitments are usually relatively 
stable.  To speak of the base `i.eroding` is, then, to 
connote the existence of destructuring factors which 
compete against the base's expected perpetuation.  
The force-dynamic implications of `i.erode` therefore 
attribute to the speaker a sense of both centrifugal 
and centripetal force efficacious within the 
`q.base`/, which in turn is conceived quasi-spatially.  
`p`

`p.
Moreover, the `i.base` is not just very abstractly 
spatial (e.g., as something which has magnitude).  
Presumably, we would not speak of a politician's 
`i.eroding support` if she were, say, to 
show poorly in polls `i.in one location`/.  
Someone following Biden's campaign would be 
more likely to assert (`ref<bidensupport>;) in the context of 
recurring observations wherein someone who 
has supported %-- or who is of a demographic or 
ideological profile that would often support 
%-- Biden in the past fails to do so in the present.  
So (`ref<bidensupport>;) carries an implicit provenance where it 
would be supported by multiple concrete 
examples, which we seem to assume to be spatially 
diverse both literally and figuratively.  
We expect (`ref<bidensupport>;) to be chosen as a description of 
the current stare of Biden's campaign by someone 
who has encountered evidence of Biden losing 
support in numerous different places %-- 
sticking to a literal reading of spatial 
extent %-- and also, quite possibly, 
losing support among different `i.categories` 
of voters (a case which also justifies 
spatial figuration, more metaphorically). 
`p` 

`p.
So the spatial dimension of the metaphor in (`ref<bidensupport>;) 
implies a spatial extent of warrants %-- 
rather similar to the epistemic pattern I 
argued for in (`ref<clashes>;).  Finally, the `i.temporal` 
facet implies a pattern which the speaker might 
intend to signify both descriptively and 
epistemically.  The `i.erosion` image implies that 
the process described %-- Biden losing support 
%-- has been gradual and continuous.  We expect 
(`ref<bidensupport>;) to mean that he did not lose a lot of support all 
at once (due to some scandal, say). Plus, we 
may well hear (`ref<bidensupport>;) as inferring that the speaker 
has become increasingly `i.aware` of the trend.  
Of course, (`ref<bidensupport>;) does not imply that the speaker 
mistakenly estimated Biden's level of support, so 
that his level of support has not changed.  
But (`ref<bidensupport>;) `i.does` imply that Biden has been losing 
support on roughly the same time span as the 
speaker's process of becoming aware of 
this fact (we assume the speaker talking as 
an expert or observer of politics).  That is, 
(`ref<bidensupport>;) connotes both a speaker-relative and an 
objective assessment of the temporal parameters 
wherein the state-change implied by `i.eroding` 
occurred.     
`p`

`p.
In sum, (`ref<bidensupport>;) via its phrasing compiles numerous 
implications appertaining to the speaker's 
rational stance `visavis; the process described.  
A less metaphoric construction could well 
be less epistemically thorough: saying 
`i.Biden is not polling as well` would carry 
none of the elucidations of warrants, of 
speaker observations, of time-span, of 
causal interpretation, and so forth, which 
we project into the sentence via the 
`i.erosion` metaphor.  The point is not 
that we are attracted to metaphors because 
of a desire for pithy, elegant statements; 
I claim more specifically that we 
experience metaphoric speech as more `i.complete` 
because (via a metaphor's various facets) 
it covers a wider range of epistemic connotations.  
From this sense of completeness we are 
often, I'll then claim, led to select 
metaphoric constructions even if we do 
not self-consciously choose to endorse 
the epistemic parameters which the metaphor 
serves to discursify.
`p`

`p.
Hearkening back to my earlier comments about `q.passive cognition`/, 
the dynamic in how we, on my account, `i.gravitate` toward 
metaphor seems to clearly cut against the paradigmatic 
commitments of an `q.objective` semantics cleanly 
isolated from pragmatics.  To see this, note that 
metaphoric patterns in (`ref<bidensupport>;) and (`ref<clashes>;), I have 
claimed, are effective in significant part because they 
unify a signification of multiple epistemic attitudes 
to their propositional content, as well as the content 
itself.  So (`ref<bidensupport>;) signifies that Biden has less support 
than he once did %-- meaning that the percentage of 
voters supporting him compared to other candidates 
has decreased %-- and (`ref<clashes>;) signifies that there 
has been an increase in violent or riotous 
incidents, apparently connected to some protests 
(e.g., some of the protesters are also perpetrators).  
These are accounts of the basic propositional content 
laid out by (`ref<bidensupport>;) and (`ref<clashes>;); but they are not the 
full `i.meaning` of the sentences, because in their 
natural context I think we would surely hear them 
as adding epistemic, speaker-relative details: 
why she thinks this is happening, what warrants 
her observations, what kind of holistic interpretation 
can be imposed.  
`p`

`p.
If we now say that the `i.propositional content` 
signified via (`ref<bidensupport>;) and (`ref<clashes>;) expands beyond 
just the observed affairs, to include 
the speaker's assessments and interpretations, 
then we have to account for `i.how` this 
expanded content is communicated.  
I have suggested that metaphorical patterns 
`q.package up` multiple epistemic dimensions.  
How does this happen?  Is such assembly a 
product of conventionalized predicate-structure-disclosing 
schema, like `ColorObject;, `NounIsInPlace;, or 
`HungrySentient;?  Or do we apply a more active 
cognitive hermeneutic to uncover the epistemic 
implicatures residing in metaphoric (or other 
surface-level) figurations?        
`p`

`p.
My answer to this questions is that compositional 
patterns %-- `i.how` surface language encodes 
propositional content %-- have often indirect 
and circuitous relations to the propositional content 
involved, especially when the language chosen 
reflects multifaceted epistemic parameters 
along with base-level descriptions.  
Merely asserting that a given sentence 
%-- even in a relatively complex discursive 
register, as in (`ref<bidensupport>;) and (`ref<clashes>;), which are 
expected in relatively formal journalistic 
or academic speech rather than in casual 
dialog %-- has a particular associated 
propositional content (which is somehow 
then its `q.meaning` or a basis for its 
meaning), does not amount to a bonafide 
linguistic analysis.  The question is 
`i.how` we understand what the propositional 
content `i.is` given the exact language 
artifacts we receive.  In cases which reduce 
to `q.transparent` schema like 
`ColorObject;, `NounIsInPlace;, and 
`HungrySentient;, we can plausibly claim 
that the rules for applying those schema 
demand a passive sort of cognition.  
However, I would dispute any intimation 
that the constructional alignment 
between metaphors like `i.eroding base` 
(in politics) or `i.spilling out into the 
streets` (of violent protests) and their 
epistemic-plus-descriptive content is 
`i.passive`/, or the merely mechanical 
application of syntactic and semantic rules.       
`p`

`p.
I see this as a `i.compositional` `q.problem` for 
`q.non-cognitive` linguistic paradigms because the 
crucial mismatch is a gap between predicate 
structure and actual language.  We can analyze the 
surface-level choices as shaped by a dynamic 
which pulls toward epistemically dense and 
multi-faceted communications: for a given sentence 
we can examine how the choices informing its surface 
structure carry added epistemic detailing. 
That is, we can draw connections between the semantic 
and syntactic selections evident in a sentence and 
the package of epistemic parameters which 
are embedded in the sentences' selective principles.  
But this analysis does not appear to bear 
any direct structural relation to the propositional 
content signified: instead of a neat alignment 
between predicate structure and linguistic 
construction (as in `ColorObject;), 
we have two seemingly disconnected structural 
registers.  We can identify a certain logical 
architecture within the propositional content, 
and another structural coordination in 
metaphoric or speaker-relative articulations, 
but the structural principles of the latter 
are not directly grounded in or shaped 
around the form of the former.  
`p`

`p.
This is not to claim that propositional content has 
no influence on discourse, but that the influence 
is filtered through situational and discursive 
details; it is not especially linguistic; 
and certainly is not cognitively passive.  
That is, we formulate sentences from a situational 
vantage point informed by why we are choosing to 
speak in the first place, and by our mental 
construals of the situations around us 
%-- what is happening, and why.  We produce 
sentences bearing the context of these situations.  
We almost instinctively endow sentences with 
interpretive stances toward the situations around 
us, because we are usually actively participating 
in situations at the same time we are talking about 
them.  By virtue of this active participation, 
we experience situations not only as observed 
states of affairs %-- compilations of empirical 
givens %-- but as evolving contexts with internal 
causal and dispositional dynamics.  
We cannot help `i.but` mentally orient ourselves 
toward external affairs not only via observation of 
`i.what` obtains, but also through narrative, interpretive, 
and in a sense meta-cognitive or `q.meta-epistemic` 
stances (keeping track for ourselves `i.what` we believe  
but also `i.why`/; on what warrants).    
`p`

`p.
Insofar as we bring these interpretive dispositions to bear 
on ambient situations, it is inevitable that they will 
shape our linguistic performances: certain language-structural  
framings will `q.feel` most correct because they jive 
with our prior and ongoing narrative and interpretive 
construals.  We will most likely then produce sentences 
which feel most accurate, whether or not we consciously 
`q.choose our words` (unless we are deliberately trying 
to `i.hide` some details of the facts or of our beliefs 
relevant to them).  In short, in many linguistic performances 
we are (consciously or not) conveying (what I might call) 
`i.interpretive attitudes`/.  Certain propositional 
attitudes, moreover, can be readily accommodated 
in a `q.non-cognitive` linguistic by appeal to 
holistic `q.grounding`/: for any sentence asserting a 
fact we can prepend a clause such as `i.I want`/, 
thus designating an attitude rather than a bald 
assertion.  That is, there are entrenched and 
`q.propositionally transparent` constructions which 
encode `i.some` forms of propositional attitudes, 
as extensions to conveyed propositional content.
`p`

`p.
But the `i.interpretive attitudes` I am emphasizing here 
are not sentimental or speech-act ornamentations like 
wants of demands; rather I am focusing on 
how language reflects our narrative encapsulation, 
causal reading, or interpretive assessment of 
situations.  Inherent in being `i.aware` of 
scenarios around us is how we mentally impose 
an order on them, trace their evolution like 
a story, schematize our assemblies of belief-warrants 
via spatial or temporal gestalts.  Thus we are already 
speaking `q.from a place of` narrative, of 
causative projection, and of interpretive schema.  
In many linguistic examples I contend that the 
narrative, causative, and interpretive 
configurations through which we epistemically 
organize our understading of states of 
affairs structures language more than the 
predicate structure of the propositional content 
created by the affairs' empiricity.   
`p`

`p.
If this is true, then articulating the `i.structure of 
propositional content` has only limited value 
in linguistic analysis, because such a project only 
explains the compositional rationale for linguistic 
constructions which recapitulates this predicate 
structure mostly transparently.  In other cases, 
linguistic structure reflects the 
`i.structure of narrative`/, or the `i.structure 
of causal interpretations`/, or of the 
summarial distillations we use to interpret 
underlying patterns that are useful cognitive proxies 
for superficial observations.  
`p`

`p.
I therefore claim that in many linguistic examples 
cognition is `i.active` because only via active 
cognitive effort can we produce and then 
understand sentences shaped around narrative, causative, 
and/or interpretive dispositions rather than 
around logical organizations which just structurally 
outline their propositional signifieds.  
Asserting an `i.active` cognitive role also, 
in my mind, forecloses a paradigm wherein 
semantics is `i.ontologically`/, so to speak, 
a theory of how propositions are encoded in language 
%-- such that analysis of how these encodings 
appear `i.in the mind` are pragmatic rather than 
semantic, on the premise that the theory of 
a system need not be disciplinarily construed 
as encompassing the theory of cognitive 
behavior `i.toward` that system once cognized.  
Again, mathematics is a different field than 
the psychology of mathematics.  However, such an 
analogy of propositional `q.enregisterment` in 
language to abstract mathematics %-- where all 
cognitive activity `visavis; a putative 
logical core of language is cognition `i.of` a 
system whose norms we merely passively observe and 
follow %-- only works for that subset of linguistic 
phenomena where the role of cognition is, 
in a deep structural sense, entirely passive.  
I believe that the structuring effects of 
narrative, causative, interpretive construal 
are at least as significant for language 
overall as the passive tolerance of 
simple constructional wrappers for 
propositional content.  
`p`

`p.
Here my argument depends on there being an irreducibly 
`i.active` role for cognition; but I have also 
presented some ideas about what this role 
`i.is`/.  In particular, I have suggested that 
the cognitive role in many complex speech-acts is 
`q.epistemic`/: a phenomenon of linguistic 
structure reflecting epistemic framings and parameters 
such that produced language artifacts model 
`q.interpretive attitudes` emanating from 
speakers' situational participation.  
I will now explore further how this 
`i.epistemic cognitive role` can lead 
toward a theory or presentation of 
linguistic structure %-- in affect a meta-grammar, 
a theory of the rational forces which 
become manifest as grammatical intuitions and, 
through their aegis, syntactic rules.
