`section.Conceptual Space Theory and the Interface Theory of Meaning`
`p.
The phraseology that language is an `q.interface` %-- to
some (at least partly) prelinguistic cognitive faculties
%-- is inspired by Vakarelov's
`q.interface theory of meaning`/, which I described at the end of
Section 1.  Here I want to explore something like an
ITM as an extension to
(or perhaps a foundation for) older language-philosophy
paradigms, like Cognitive Grammar and Conceptual Role
Semantics.  I'll spend this section forecasting
how that might work.
`p`

`p.
Conceptual Space Theory, on the other hand,
originates with Peter `Gardenfors;'s books
and articles %-- especially 2000's `i.Conceptual
Spaces: The Geometry of Thought` %-- but has branched
from linguistics to disciplines like computer science
and the Philosophy of Science.  Conceptual Space Theory
emerges from Cognitive Linguistics, and therefore
resists simple AI paradigms of language
following essentially mechanical rules,
or logically decoding and processing symbols.
But at the same time, `Gardenfors; argues that
we can find some `i.quantitative` structure
in conceptual structures %-- including identifying
axes of variation where notions of prototype
and exemplars can be formally modeled; and
representing perceptual and spatial features through
numeric measures, like the color double-pyramid
(which grounds the Hue, Saturation, Value color space
widely used for computer graphics).
`p`

`p.
To the extent that perceptual and spatial features can be
quantified, it is easy to develop intuitions for prototype
theories and conceptual similarity: for example,
an exemplary `i.red tablecloth` would have
a certain almost-red hue and rectangular dimensions.
Varying the color or making the shape too large or
small, or oblong, corresponds to moving from the
`q.prototypical` space of the concept to borderline cases.
These examples are appealing because they suggest that
conceptual dispositions can be systematically modeled;
the behind-the-scenes mental gears that classify something
as `i.tablecloth` or `i.knife` seem to have some
scientifically tractable lawfulness, not just a
cognitive black box that linguistics takes for granted.
`p`

`p.
As I see it, the challenge for Conceptual Space Theory is
how to generalize outside the intuitively trenchant but
rather narrow examples of conceptual `q.quantification`/, like
color and shape, to model the full range of details %--
including functional and conceptual roles as well
as perceptual form %-- which influence conceptualization.
After all, while there `i.are` spatial differences between
a `i.tablecloth`/, `i.placemat`/, and `i.ribbon`
%-- or between a `i.knife`/, `i.sword`/, and `i.cleaver`
%-- these represent different `i.concepts` because the
objects serve different enactive ends.  Their various
spatial morphologies are byproducts of practical design, and
do not `i.cause` differences in conceptualization, although it
is often via spatial form that we `i.recognize` an object
as a knife, etc.  Integrating Conceptual
Spaces into a multifaceted `i.cognitive` linguistics would seem
to call for examining Conceptual Spaces not just as vehicles
for `i.object recognition` but within the
spectrum of interpersonal, enactive, and
situational understanding that lies behind
linguistic signification and performance.
`p`

`p.
Research in the overall context of Conceptual Space Theory
has, however, examined these more situational
and functional dimensions.  There are several tactics for
cashing the basic `q.Geometry of Thought` metaphor
outside the obvious geometric model of, say,
prototypical tablecloths having prototypical rectangular
dimensions.
`p`

`p.
One option is to consider conceptual `q.space`
as encompassing enactive dimensions as well as
spatial/perceptual ones.  We can do certain familiar things
with tablecloths: place them over a table, fold them, launder them;
and with knives: place them on a table, sharpen them, wash them
under running water, use them to cut food.  The more
that two objects share a similar set of affordances, the
more that they are likely to be conceptually
similar.  As such, conceptual `i.roles` can substitute for
`q.metrizable` dimensions (like color and shape, which can
be directly quantified in a distance space) as a ground
for modeling similarity and prototypicality.
`p`

`p.
Another idea is to consider the kind of (canonically perceptual)
attributes which via Conceptual Spacs we can analyze
quantitatively as `i.triggers` to more multi-faceted
cognitive activity.  When we see an object which
`i.looks` like a prototypical knife
or tablecloth, this spurs further conceptualizations
%-- and/or enactive engagement with the object %-- that
thematize the object more functionally and situationally.
The perceptual triggers then need to be analyzed as
part of the overall cognitive process.  In that
case the `q.geometric` space where concepts can be situated
represents not so much the definitive cognitive
stature of the object, but a `i.provisional`
conceptualization which unfolds into more complex
(and less directly perceptual) machinations.
`p`

`p.
This latter model actually integrates well with Vakarelov's ITM:
as I already argued in Section 1, language is best viewed as
an integration of multiple cognitive subsystems.
One such subsystem, which acts like a perceptual-cognitive
interface, maybe well-served by a Conceptual Space model
that stays close to `Gardenfors;'s original geometric metaphor.
Other subsystems, engaged more with the list of
affordances embodied in a concept (and, concretely, in its
tokens) needs to be modeled with a more abstract/functional kind
of `q.space`/.
`p`

`p.
Given this possibility, I believe that the systematizing
gambits of ITM and Conceptual Space Theory can be
integrated.  In this section I will argue that
formal attempts to implement Conceptual Spaces in computational
settings are consistent with the ITM architecture.
This does not mean, however, that a Conceptual Space/ITM hybrid
can be unproblemmatically lifted to a computational model for
human cognition.  The idea that our overall cognition
`i.integrates` many subsystems means that a computational
theory of any one subsystem is not necessarily a
step toward genuine AI.  It may be that there is
something salienty human about how we
`i.integrate` the totality of our cognitive
dispositions into socialized, context-sensitive, empathic
behaviors.
`p`

`p.
So in this section I will generally approach
efforts to `i.operationalize` Conceptual Spaces
%-- and look back to Vakarelov's paradigm as well
%-- with a mixture of critique and endoresement.
In general I think that these thories are
useful models %-- or at least useful starting-points
%-- for understanding components within cognitive systems
which are `i.locally` structured and formalizable.  This
does not mean I endorse a `i.holisitic` picture of
human cognition as simplistically computational
or simulatable.  In any kind of `q.interface theory`/,
there is an implicit distinction between
`i.local` analysis and `i.global` systematic qualities.
An interface is, canonically, poised between two
other structures: it can be analyzed internally
through the lens of its own structures %-- how
it effects translations and routing between the
structures of other systems which the
interface interconnects %-- but this `q.local`
analysis does not address how local structures
fit into the `q.semantics` of the whole.
`p`

`p.
The `q.semantics of the whole` is often where science gives
way to Philosophy of Science %-- or even to
Phenomenology.  The `q.local` language of chemistry, for example,
principally describes phenomena at the molecular level,
like chemical bonds and intermolecular forces.
Analogously, the local language of biology
describes phenomena at the cellular level, like
compounds diffusing in the blood stream.  The
chemistry-scale phenomena may provide causal-explanatory
grounds for the biological %-- chemical
properties of blood and alchohol, for
example, dictate how alchohol enters the blood stream.  But
we need a holistic integration to perceive this at
a higher level, as an empirical phenomenon affecting the organism
as a whole: alchohol enters the bloodsteam
and can impair our normal cognitive functioning,
even causing harm if consumed at toxic levels.
We need the everyday concepts and language
%-- e.g., describing someone as `i.drunk`
or `i.posioned` %-- to orient the biological
and chemical languages to empirical reality.  Biology
and chemistry are not abstract systems; they
are intended to explain phenomena in the world,
but `i.which` phenomena they are explaining is not something
captured `q.locally` in either biological or chemical
language.
`p`

`p.
To the degree, then, that we can (`q.metascientifically`/)
analyze the interaction between biological and chemical
laws/properties as an `i.interface`/,
an `q.interface theory` of this relationship
%-- of biology supervening on chemistry,
for instance, goes hand-in-hand with a `i.holistic`
theory of the worldly phenomena which
biology and chemistry (and their interaction/reuction)
explain.  The interface theory is not a self-contained
explanation, but a `i.local` analysis which needs
an overarching holistic picture to cement its
explanatory value.
`p`

`p.
I believe this biology/chemistry case is a good metaphor
for cognitive science in relation to
Cognitive Linguistics and to phenomnology.
We can theorize various cognitive subsystems,
analogous to chemistry and biology %--
suppose we take both perceptual and
affordance-based Conceptual Space models, Vakarelov's
$M$ and $S$ subsystems, and the proto-computational
frameworks like `i.feature vectors` or
`i.expectations` developed in a Conceptual Space framework
as I will mention below %-- so these thories
become analogs in the explanation of
human `i.mind` to chemistry and biology in explanations
of the human `i.body`/.  But these are still local
analyses, and we need an overarching account of
how different cognitive subsystems `q.interface together`
to yield, as an emergent totality, what we experience
as human mind and consciousness.
`p`

`p.
Ultimately, I believe this holistic picture needs to be
developed at a philosophical level, rooted in
fields like phenomenology and Cognitive Grammar.
This means that these fields should recognize the formal
merit of scientific %-- even computational %--
analyses of `i.aspects` of cognition while
arguing against reductive theories of cognition and
consciousness as a holistic reality.  In the absense of
a phenomenological paradigm which is willing to
both engage and transcend subsystem analyses, our
`i.holistic` picture of mind tends to be
dominated by AI and logical or computational
reductionism.  That's a subject
for the next section; my goal here
is to look at Conceptual Space theory as
a useful but partial `q.subsystem` theory.
`p`

`spsubsectiontwoline.Conceptual Space Theory and Phenomenology`
`p.
Towards the end of Section 1 I noted the contrast between how the
word `q.cognitive` itself seems to do different
`q.theoretical work` in Cognitive Linguistics
compared to, say, AI research.  I also argued that the
differences are not necessarily irreconcilable: while
humans are not the only cognitive system,
there is a distinctly human way of `i.being` a
cognitive system.  Analogously, while humans
are not the only communicative species %-- actually,
we are not the only `i.linguistic` species;
it seems counter-productive not call bird sounds or cetacean
and primate vocalizations as a kind of language %-- there
is however a distinctly human way of `i.being`
linguistic.  Not all language is `i.human`
language; but language which `i.is` human
absorbs the specificity of human sociality and
consciousness into its signifying processes.
It is on `i.that` level, I would argue,
that we should read the `q.cognition` in
Cognitive Grammar, Cognitive Linguistics,
or Cognitive Phenomenology.
`p`

`p.
Taking Langacker's Cognitive Grammar as canonical,
I think scholars in that tradition would agree
that we instinctively reach for cognitive
frames to interpret linguistically-encoded situations.
Research can uncover structural features of linguistic
understanding by identifying
frequent structural primitives of these frames:
consider the landmark-trajector structure in
(`ref<itm:across>;), the force-dynamic contrast
in (`ref<itm:pour>;) vs. (`ref<itm:spill>;) and
(`ref<itm:puton>;) vs. (`ref<itm:spatter>;),
and the spatial/geometric
variations in (`ref<itm:colorallover>;)-(`ref<itm:sheetallover>;): |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:across -> Our house is across the lake. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:pour -> I poured wine from a decanter. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:spill -> Some wine spilled from the decanter. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:puton -> I put spackle on the wall with a knife. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:spatter -> Paint spattered all over the wall after a can droppped. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:colorallover -> There's a purple-and-blue color pattern all over the wall. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> There are drawings all over the wall. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:sheetallover -> There's a plastic sheet all over the wall. -> cog ;;
`sentenceList`
`p`

`p.
There are underlying perceptual gestalts which seem apparent
in these examples, and their linguistic expression seems
to take these as cognitive-perceptual primitives
rather than grist for analysis (compare to a case
like wanting the Leafs to win, when asked about the
Jets (`ref<itm:rooting>;, above)). This is consistent with the
phenomenological intuition that consciousness includes a
primordial structural awareness, and the role of
intellect and attention is to focus
on local regions of the whole structural
cloth of experience, for enactive deliberateness
and/or information extraction at a level of precision
that `q.raw` experience cannot provide.  The
important phenomenological contrast is not between
`q.sense data`/, on the one hand, and intellectually
filtered or reified world-apprehension,
on the other; but rather between a structured
cognitive-perceptual complex which we feel as
`i.ambient` experience and, within that, an actively
thematized attentional focal-region that we
experience ourselves to be forcefully
studying and interacting with.
`p`

`p.
For phenomenology, then, ambient `q.background experience` is
already richly structured and is not really
`q.pre-cognitive`/, because its structure evinces
the `q.grammar` of cognitive frames.  On the other hand,
there are other intellectual traditions
where `q.cognitive` carries more of a rational-analytic
overtone.   I suspect those who identify as Cognitive
Linguists understand the word in a more phenomenological
mien, whereas the AI and formal logic community places
greater emphasis on how cognitive `i.systems`
may be formally tractable.  This can yield
confusion in linguistics proper, where AI (at
least in the sense of Natural Language Processing)
and Cognitive Linguistics co-exist.  One solution
is to qualify `q.cognitive` in
contexts where confusion could arise,
e.g. `q.cognitive-perceptual` as a more phenomenological
sense and `q.cognitive-analytic` as a more computational
sense.
`p`

`p.
Note, however, that the re-occurrence of `q.cognitive`
in both terms is accidental: as suggested by the terminological
pattern, I think we should see `q.cognitive-perceptual`
and `q.cognitive-analytic` as part of a spectrum whose
`q.axis` represents attention and dispositional structurality.
That is to say, on the more cognitive-percepetual side we may
be aware of structural details (cf. Vakarelov's `q.nomic patterns`/)
but do not consciously attend to them, such that
they remain latent as the manner of disclosure of
sensate content: for example, the way in which a
certain car appears as red is to appear as a metallic
red hue with a glinting lighter patch
following the length of the car.  This perceptual
complex has geometric structure %-- it is not an
undifferentiated red-sensation %-- but I comport to such
content specificity in a passive manner.  Towards the other
(cognitive-analytic) end of the spectrum, I deliberately seek
out awareness of structural forms, analyzing them
in relation to schemas and prototypes
(consider a rock-climber planning how to scale a wall).
Within this spectrum I think there
are continuous gradations; and such a picture
seems more phenomenologicaly
well-motivated than a cognitive/pre-cognitive duality.
`p`

`p.
Concepts qua cognitive tools are influential across this spectrum.
An architect analyzing the facade of a historic builing
will experience its structure in greater detail and
attention than a bystander who's meeting
a friend in front of the building.  The concept
`q.facade` will nonetheless shape how both people make
sense of their surroundings.  The bystander may have a more passive
acknowledgment that she is before the facade, compared to
the architect (but it
will nonetheless be part of her relatively deliberate
attempt to coordinate with her friend's expectation
that they meet in front of the building).  Moreover, a child
who had not yet learned the word `q.facade` would
see the characteristics of buildings' exterior that
fall under the concept, but more passively still.
Merely learning the word presumably alters our perception
of exteriors qua facades vs. `q.ordinary` exteriors, even
if we are not currently using the word in any
conversation %-- just as the word `q.hail`
sharpens our perception to how hail differs from
snow, since we have a compilations of beliefs specific
to `i.hail` (apart from `i.snow`/), and thinking
(even if passively) that some precipitation is the
former, not the latter, triggers us to
activate those hail-specific beliefs.  Another
analogous case would be identifying milk
as actually almond milk, or water as actually salt-water:
the more granular our inventory of lexicalized
concepts, the more precise becomes the package of
prior knowledge we instinctively make on hand in
the current situation.
`p`

`p.
Insofar as knowledge of the word reinforces the concept,
we can assume the concept and our disposition to
name it lexically is latent in situations where the concept
`i.may` be relevant.  Thus the friend might
comment on the facade once they have met in front of the
building: making explicit something that hitherto
the parties, we assume, had just passively noticed.
This is an example of the kind of unstated assumptions about
others' beliefs that lie beneath explicit
linguistic content: `q.I love this building's facade`
presuposses both that the hearer sees the facade and
understands the concept.
`p`

`p.
I use the `q.facade` example stratgically, to reference
Martin Raubal's analysis of this word via
Conceptual Space Theory `cite<MartinRaubal>;.
Raubal proposes a `q.conceptual vector
space` to  distinguish `i.facades` from other spatial
arrangements that (for instance) we might encounter outdoors
in an urban setting.  His apparent goal is to
quantitatively model the terrain of `q.facade` in
contrast to other, lexically related words, which would
yield a basically mechanical, computationally tractable
account of how to recognize a facade %-- perhaps
for programming a robot, or a navigation tool
for people, as he proposes.
`p`


`p.
Such potential applications trade on the possibility that we
can reach beneath the nuance of language and uncover
logically straightforward encodings of, or criteriology for,
concepts %-- not unlike my earlier idea of a
genetic/vinological `q.CF` for `q.Cabernet Franc`/.
Obviously, finding a logical matrix beneath
the surface fluidity of language is an essential
first step toward legitimate Natural Language Processing.
`p`

`p.
But trying to map an everyday (e.g., non-technical) concept
to a readily-enumerated `q.feature vector` is not without
problems, I think.  Conceptual Space Theory
is not the same as a prototype-based semantics, but it could
share some of its problems when dealing with shape-shifting
everyday concepts; the likes of `i.house` or `i.restaurant`
or `i.water`/.  A prototype (or feature-vector) theory of
`i.house` would need to unify mansions with hovels but
exclude hotels, tents, apartments, apartment-buildings,
and historical estates that have become museums.  The criteria
for `q.house` and `q.restaurant` seem mostly functional,
although we are still aware in English of a conceptual
incongruity in extending the concept on
purely functional terms.  We can acceptably
use `q.house`/, really, for any place of residence %-- and
restaurant for anywhere to buy prepared meals: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl ->> I'm going to a party at my brother's house (suppose
he actually lives in an apartment). -> itm:apartment ->  I'm going to a party at my brother's house. -> sem ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl ->> This restaurant has the best Hokkien noodles
(said of a stall in a Chinatown food court). -> --- -> This restaurant has the best Hokkien noodles. -> sem ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

These feel (at least to my ears) like idiomatic
expressions, however, as if we know not to casually
overstretch the concepts.  As I proposed earlier, our
criteria for concept-mappings seems to be `i.mostly` functional
but to incorporate spatial, configurational, visual, and
natural-kind features also as `i.secondary` criteria.  I
would argue that a Conceptual Space model intuitively
grounded on these latter features would supplement,
rather than displace, a Conceptual Role theory
(Conceptual Space Theory does account for functional
roles, but arguably a little awkwardly).`footnote.
For instance, Raubal says that `q.Meanings of concepts change over time
and depending on the context in which they are used.
In a conceptual vector space it is possible to account
for these changes by adding or deleting quality dimensions
and by assigning different saliencies (as weights)
to the existing dimensions`
`cite<[page 5]MartinRaubal>;.  For sure, our readiness to
(continuing my example) accept `q.house` for any place
of residence varies with context: the idiomatic
usage in (`ref<itm:apartment>;) is less proper in the contxt of
real estate transactions, or assessing property
tax (an available apartment should not be
called a `q.house for sale`/).  But while
`q.assigning different saliencies` may capture the relative
weight of functional vs. more
prototype-based classifications, attempts to
quantify functional dimensions themselves as if
they were, say, colors and spatial geometries %-- which do
have convincing quantitative models
(e.g. `q.red` on an HSV color pyramid) %-- strike
me as forced and unpersuasive.
`footnote`
`p`

`p.
But setting this objection aside, we can defer to Raubal's
analysis to the effect that a `q.conceptual vector space` can
model our disposition to actively or passively identify
concept-instances as such.  Standing before a building,
the proper synergy between properties of
a a facade and my own mental `q.vector` of the colors,
spatial arrangements, patterns, and so forth iconifying
the idea `q.facade` %-- if the synergy resonates enough
%-- primes me to know instinctively that the exterior
is a facade, a pasive belief which could potentially
be `q.activated` should that become relevant.  One way this
could happen is if a conversation partner
says something about `q.this facade` %--
entering that referent in the `q.ledger` of dialogically
salient things and topics.
`p`

`p.
So the efficacy of the concept lies not just in the reality
available for us to peceive, nor in our minds, but
in a synergy between reality-structures and activatable conceptual
models.  This kind of partial-but-not-total externalism is perhaps
roughly what Vakarelov considers to be `q.precognitive`/:
the phenomenon of our perceiving an exterior
as a `q.facade` depends on both mental and extramental factors.
`Gardenfors; Conceptual Space Theory can be seen in this
context as an attempt to imagine an `q.abstract geometry` to
quantify (or to suggestively intimate
the possibility of quantifying) the world-to-word fit that
predetermines (and is witnessed by) well-founded
conceptualizations.  `Gardenfors;'s `q.geometry of thought` can
accordingly be seen as an attempt to capture
via quantitative intuition an
insight Vakarelov's ITM broaches qualitatively: the idea that
cognition is a structural `i.correlation` between
the reality out there and what we're equipped to conceptualize.
`p`

`p.
Perhaps, then, Conceptual Space Theory is (or can be
applied for) one example of a Vakarelov-style
ITM.  Raubal proposes conceptual vector spaces not
just as theoretical explanantia but as technological
artifacts; he envisions software employing these
vectors as assistive technologies capable of some
natural-language understanding.  A computational system
which properly activated the `q.facade` concept, let's say, given
sufficiently proximate feature-vectors, would
perhaps exemplify Vakarelov's idea of an `q.information
system` that resembles human cognition, to some functional
degree.  The fact that such-and-such an environmental
given resembles (in the conceptual-space-vector
metric) a prototypical facade, or falls in the
facade `q.region` (in a high-dimesnional concept-vector space),
acts as a kind of input or signal.  For Vakarelov, such
quasi-cognitive (or actually cognitive, like the human mind)
systems are organized in layers; it is consistent
with his subsystem model to say that concept-vector metrics
would be recognized by one subsystem, as `q.effectors`/, generating
signals to be received by other subsystems.  One such signal
would be, say, a passive awareness that %-- based
on distances in some feature vector %-- we are now
standing before the facade of a building.
`p`

`p.
Another computational strategy for Conceptual Space Theory is
suggested by Kenneth Holmqvist's chapter on `q.conceptual
engineering` (mentioned by Raubal's paper I've
cited, but also noteworthy as an unusual attempt to
apply computational methods to
Cognitive Linguistics).  Whereas Raubal skirts
around functional-role issues, Holmqvist acknowledges that
functionality can be the decisive factor in conceptual frames.
He cites the example of a knife, which
can on the one hand be prototyped
spatially and mereologically (e.g., the relative
sizes of blade and handle and the knife's
status as the sum of those parts), but also
functionally %-- `q.Take the lexical unit
`i.knife` as an example ... `i.blade` and
`i.handle` are clearly parts of `i.knife`
[which also] has `i.silverware` as a `i.whole`/:
`i.knife` is one of the parts in collections making
up silverware.  But `i.knife` can also have `i.cut`
as a whole, because  `i.knife` can be the agent ... of
the cutting process` `cite<[page 155]KennethHolmqvist>;.
As is clear, Holmqvist
adopts mereology as a very broad domain of relations,
representing different functional and aggregative
connections as special cases of part/wholeness.
But more significant is that Holmqvist (given this generality)
is prepared to model a broad range of relationships %-- even
if these can in principle be expressed mereologically
(like a knife as part of a silverware set),
we are not restricted to only visual or physical
partonomies.
`p`

`p.
The parts of Holmqvist's analyses that are more
perceptually grounded are also the more prototype-like.
He comments, for instance, that `q.saying ... `i.blade` is part of
`i.knife` is not sufficient.  We must characterize this part-whole
relation closer.  For instance, the relative sizes of the
blade and knife must not deviate outside certain limits.  The
relative spatial position of the blade and knife must also be
correct, i.e., the blade must be correctly attached`/.
This implies that the criteria for classifying something as a knife
can be quantified, and regions on certain peceptual axes
%-- say, the shape, length, and position of the
handle and the blade %-- carve out (no pun intended) the
conceptual space of `i.knife` from peer concepts like
`i.sword`/, `i.cleaver`/, and `i.spatula`/.  Certainly
such clusters of related lexemes suggest conceptual
`q.terrains` that can be `q.mapped` %-- as in my earlier
discussion of concept-mapping for water and milk %-- and
Conceptual Space Theory draws on our intuition
that such mappings are particularly elegant when
there is a readily quantifiable system of dimensions
that can be identified, like blade-length distinguishing
knives from swords.  Again, however, functional
pragmatics, more than spatial form in itself, seems to
dictate when and how we identify concept-instances
with their concepts.
`p`

`p.
Holmqvist however recognizes this possibility by talking not
only of perceptual part/wholes (like blade/knife)
but of mereologies with more functional inflection, like
a knife in a silverware set or as part of `q.cut` insofar
as `q.cutting` something can be a perceptual-operational
gestalt, whose `q.parts` are both the agent and patient of
cutting.  These more abstract mereologies find
linguistic expression in cases like: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> He had to cut the crusty bread with a serrated knife. -> cog ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> The museum had antique butter knives with intricate carvings. -> cog ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

The implied situational picture in each case is structured, in part,
mereologically: a museum-piece knife potentially part of a valuable
cutlery set; and when slicing bread with a serrated knife the
knife is part of an enactive process.  However, I'd say
the functional position of the knives in these various
situations is the key detail, over and
above the partonomic significance of situational
wholes.  A butter knife rests in a different
niche in culinary situations than a bread
knife.  Their roles are however similar
enough that we can subsume them under a
common knife-concept, although we can
likewise distinguish them, `i.bread`/-knife
and `i.butter`/-knife forming two sub-concepts.
`p`

`p.
We should highlight the functional roles because
these dispose us to recognize the concept and the
subconcepts.  We reach for a butter knife if we want to
butter bread; it is that practical goal which primes
us to see the butter knife as a knife, in general,
and a butter knife, in particular.  Insofar as there is
a synergy between our mind and our environment, manifest
in the adequacy of concepts like `q.butter knife`/,
this is primarily a matter of %-- in this case %--
the object conceptualized as a butter knife being
suited for that task.  Of course, part of the reason
`i.why` it is so suited is how it is shaped and
manufactured.  Geometric and physical details are therefore
relevant for our inclination to identify (butter)
knives.  Mostly, however, these details are
derivative on functional roles, rather than the
preeminent criteria of conceptualizations.
`p`

`p.
Having said that, an unused butter knife is still a butter
knife.  Table settings include butter knives so we can
conveniently reach for one as needed.  Our appreciation
that we `i.might` need a butter knife, or how `i.some`
diners might need one, and how they are used, informs
our conceptualizing dispositions.  It is true that perceptual
details like color and shape provide visual cues to the nature of
objects %-- partly because they need the design and material
composition they have to perform their intended purpose.  But we
don't just troll sense-data looking for cues; our
perceptual awareness is not a matter of decontextualized
equations like `q.shiny and sharp means `i.knife`/`/,
`q.liquid and clear means `i.water`/`/, etc.
Our receptivity to concept-instances depends on our awareness
of current situations.  It's not like we are prepared
to see examples of every kind of object that we are familiar with
in every situation.  We anticipate finding butter knives
on a dining table, or in a kitchen.  Situational awareness brings with
it a selective anticipation %-- knowing
what kinds of objects are likely to be associated with each situation
prevents our having to devote excess thought to identifying objects,
or misidentifying similar-looking ones.
`p`

`p.
So even if we accept features like color and shape as `q.triggers` for
concept-recognition, our receptivity to these triggers is conditioned
by situational understanding %-- which is an example of cognitive frames.
These frames, moreover, are defined in terms of functional
roles: the salient characteristic of a bread knife is the fact that
it can cut bread, and the salient characteristic of a butter knife is the
fact that it can spread butter.  The situation provides the conceptual
slots that objects can fit into.

There is, notwithstaning my suggestions to this point, a version of
prototype theory which `i.is` broadly applicable.
Situational understanding, we can say, `i.does` proceed from `i.situational`
prototypes, so here is a domain where prototype theories are appropriate.
Instead of a prototypical `i.knife` (or house, restaurant, corkscrew,
etc.), I think we have `i.prototypical situations` where knives
(etc.) play a role.  Any particular knife is conceptualized
against such a background: one kind of scenario is someone at
the head of the table ceremonially carving a roast, wherein the
knife is a `q.carving knife`/; another scenario
is someone spreading butter, wherein it is a `q.butter knife`/; etc.
Each situation-prototype is an architecture of roles,
where for instance there is a person enacting the carving
ritual, the instrument she uses, the food being carved, and so on.
The building-blocks of these architectures then
become solicited within language, for instance
via case-markers like benefactive, locative, patientive:
`q.carving `i.the turkey` for `i.grandma` with `i.the knife` at
`i.the counter`/`/.
`p`

`p.
In practice, our sensitivity to functional roles allows for ad-hoc
practical configurations, like using a hammer as a bottle-opener.
To the degree that situation-prototypes are `i.abstract` models,
we nonetheless have narrower appraisals of functional
roles: the lexeme `q.bottle opener` covers objects playing
that role in `i.prototypical` situations, which
is why it does not cover hammers.  This is one reason why we should
accept conceptual-role talk as more parsimonious than
functional-role talk: conceptual roles `i.are` functional
roles, but tapered down by the prototypicality of
situations abstractly conceived.
`p`

`p.
In practical affairs, of course, we comport to real
situations %-- that may embody situational prototypes,
but no real context, with its idiosyncratic details, is
entirely prototypical.  This
concreteness has a pair of distinct implications
for my current analysis.  First, we accept
localized expansions of conceptual roles, like
bottle-opener-to-corskcrew or even -to-hammer.  Second,
conceptual roles offer templates that allow cognitive-perceptual
judgments to be passive or instinctive %-- we reach
for a butter knife without being aware of concluding
that said instrument is a butter knife, or even really being
aware of knowing that a butter knife is there.
`p`

`p.
So the practical purpose of curating a `q.library` of
conceptual-role accounts is to prime us, given
each situation, to identify objects fulfilling
conceptual roles `i.passively`/, as part of
unattended, background consciousness.  Once we
become aware of specific enactive needs %-- the thought that
we need a knife or a corkscrew, part of some
practical task being now phenomenologically active,
a focus of attention %-- the more
passive perceptual details (like a knife's
shape and color) are poised to trigger
more active conceptual recognition. Now we become consciously
aware of the butter knife nearby, and of picking it
up and using it.
`p`

`p.
Perceptual details can certainly be triggers of conceptual
recognition, but a complex interleave of situational
awareness, situational prototypes, pre-learned conceptual roles,
and moment-to-moment enactive needs and processes, all
establish an infrastructure within
which perceptual content can actually `q.trigger`
determinate conceptualizations.  Most of this
activity is prelinguistic %-- it establishes a
cognitive baseline that language builds off of.
But there is enough commonality between different
persons' situational models that we can
understand how these cognitive processes are
working for other people, and therefore can
draft them into the circle of language: if
we, holding a slice of bread, ask someone
for a butter-knife, we trust they will instinctively
grasp both my enactive requirements and have the
cognitive resources to help achieve them.
`p`

`p.
In sum, our ability to convert passive situational awareness
and `q.background consciousness` perception, mediated hy
situation-prototypes, into active cognitive-perceptual
conceptualizations and pragmatic representations
(of the `q.here's a butter knife I can use` variety) is
itself, in total, a cognitive system which can
be `i.targeted` by language, however much it is itself
prelinguistic.  That analysis, if it holds
water, would make language an `i.interface` to the
aforementioned cognitive system.  Under that interpretation,
my reading, originating in Conceptual Space Theory and
then pivoting to Conceptual Roles,
also presents as a flavor of ITM.  I envision this hybird
theory as a kind of synthesis of Conceptual Space Theory,
Conceptual Role Semantics, and (at least some variation on)
Vakarelov's Interface Theory of Meaning.
`p`

`p.
Situational awareness, and situationally-mediated
object recognition and associated conceptualizations,
are highly subtle and multifacted cognitive faculties
%-- especially in our purposeful, socially normative,
often emotionally charged human world.  Some aspects of
this overall architecture may be interestingly modeled
or emulated with computers.  Examples include
Raubal's and Holmqvist's implementations based on
Conceptual Spaces, or Holmqvist's approach also intended
to present computational models of Langacker-style
Cognitive Linguistics, a goal
shared by some other work, like Matt Selway's
`cite<MattSelway>;.  To this we could add certain models
embraced by phenomenologists like Barry Smith and
his collaborators (notably `cite<BittnerSmithDonnelly>;) and
Jean Petitot.  I am skeptical that
computer implementations will ever
achieve more than a rough approximation of human
enaction or language understanding
%-- valuable perhaps as a research case-study and for
specific useful tools, but nothing like
robotic substitutes for human bodies and minds.  But
computer tools can still play an important role in
research, by giving formal outlines
to cognitive architectures which appear to
have some formal dynamics, even if the raw materials
of cognition %-- like sensation, situational awareness, and
empathy %-- may not be formally tractable.
