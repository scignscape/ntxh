`section.Conceptual Role Semantics and Externalism`

`p.
Conceptual Role Semantics is often discussed together
with a particular internalism/externalism debate
which it tends to engender.  Here I want to
defend a kind of Conceptual Role Semantics (hereafter
CRS) but I will first outline an account
of compromise between externalism and internalism.
I will suggest a compromise different, I believe,
than Ned Block's `q.two factor` model that seems
considered the leading example of an
externalist/internalist hybrid.
`p`

`p.
The basic CRS picture is that linguistic meanings
should be associatd with conceptual roles in our
understanding situations more than in terms
of their reference to external objects.  Given
sentences like: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:ornate -> He opened the wine bottle with an ornate corkscrew. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:butterfly -> He opened the beer bottle with a butterfly corkscrew. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; He collects antique corkscrews and just bid on one online.
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:screwtop -> I thought this was a screw-top but it turns out I need a corkscrew. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:x3d -> This X3D file shows a very realistic corkscrew created with NURBS surfaces. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:sendx3d -> Could you send me the corkscrew (the X3D file you just mentioned)? -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

we should interpret `q.corkscrew`/, first, as a concept
in a kind of functional organization.  In some of these sentences
there is also a specific corkscrew (qua phsyical object) on hand
as a referent, but its actual physical properties %-- or
even identity %-- is not decisive for the meaning of
the sentence.  After all, in (`ref<itm:screwtop>;) the speaker is
not thinking of any corkscrew in particular (probably
%-- more on that later) and in (`ref<itm:x3d>;) and
(`ref<itm:sendx3d>;) the corkscrew is
not real (at least not real qua corkscrew).
But the conceptualization associated with `q.corkscrew` does
not seem markedly different in (`ref<itm:ornate>;) or
(`ref<itm:butterfly>;) versus (`ref<itm:screwtop>;),
at least (more on the other three later).
`p`

`p.
Not only physical details but even lexical identity
seems tangential to the important conceptual
meanings.  Suppose I am hosting two guests,
one has a magnum of ale and one a bottle of Malbec.
They ask, respectively: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> Do you have a bottle opener? -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> Could you get me a corkscrew? -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

and I give the first guest a butterfly corkscrew and the
second a folding multi-knife.  What I gave them is
different from their request, but they should think
nothing of it insofar as the winged corkscrew has a
gap on its handle suitable for beer bottles and the
multi-knife has a fold-out corkscrew helix.  I have
not violated any conversational maxims, because I
reasonably assume that the instruments I gave them
are suitable for the desired goals, of opening their
bottles.  Semantically `q.corkscrew` really means
`q.something that can be used to open a wine bottle`/,
and in that sense the lexeme gets its principle content
from this operational role, not some list of attributes
(like spirally and graspable) or prototypes.
`p`

`p.
Granted, a suitably designed winged corscrew can be
construed as a kind of bottle opener, and a multi-knife
a kind of corkscrew respectively.  We are prepared to
accept these tools as examples of the respctive
concepts if they are functionally designed to support
those tasks, even if such are not the primary function.
But our inclination allowing concepts to dilate
modulo functional criteria suggest that our grasp of
concepts is first and foremost functional-pragmatic:
we tend to internalize concepts in reference to
(extralinguistic) functional roles and expand concepts
to accommodate variegated implementers of those roles.
`p`

`p.
We can indeed accept sentences like: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:hammer -> He opened the bottle of beer with a hammer. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> He pounded the nail with a lever corkscrew. -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Of course here we are inserting objects into a conceptual
nexus where they are not usually found.  Winged corkscrews
are often `i.designed` to double as bottle-openers, but
lever corkscrews are not designed to double
as hammers.  Nevertheless we have no trouble imagining
the scenarios being described, where someone uses
the thick part of a corkscrew to pound a nail, or a
hammer's handle/claw gap to pry off a bottle cap.  We have
schemata for `q.a tool to open a capped bottle` and
`q.a tool to pound a nail`/, and the concepts
of bottle-opener and hammer occupy that conceptual niche
insofar as they are artifacts designed for those purposes.
But the conceptual `q.slot` for, say, `q.a tool to
open a capped bottle` is more general than
the specific tools designed for those purposes.
`p`

`p.
We nonetheless `i.would` be presumably violating
conversational maxims if we handed our friend who
wanted to open a beer bottle a hammer.  Even if
there's a way to make the hammer work for that
purpose, it's further outside the norm than, referring
back to (`ref<itm:butterfly>;), proposing to use a winged corkscrew.
So the implicature in (`ref<itm:butterfly>;) is satisfied, let's say,
by bringing my guest a winged corkscrew, but not a
hammer.  But we can entertain the `i.thought` of using
a hammer as a bottle-opener, and even this
possibility presents problems for simplistic
thories of language acquistion as essentially learning
a static set of word correspondences, like
`q.a hammer is used to pound nails` or `q.a corkscrew
is used to open wine` %-- after all, you cannot conclude
from: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl ->> A hammer is something used to pound nails, `i.and` -> --- -> A hammer is something used to pound nails. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl ->> A lever corkscrew is something used to open wine, `i.and` -> --- -> A lever corkscrew is something used to open wine. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl ->> A lever corkscrew can be used to pound nails -> --- -> A lever corkscrew can be used to pound nails. -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

that a hammer is a kind of lever corkscrew and can
therefore open wine.  What we
`i.do` have are conceptual slots available encapsulating
ideas like `q.that which can open bottles` or
`q.that which can pound nails`/, and we `q.fill` these
conceptual slots with different lexical content
in different situations.  The
`q.that which can open capped bottles` slot can be filled
descriptively %-- i.e., in declarative speech,
like in (`ref<itm:hammer>;) %-- by a hammer, but not in
other kinds of speech acts (we cannot read the concept
`q.bottle opener` as satisfied by `q.hammer` in
the context of a request for a bottle opner).  Note that
the scope of conceptual roles can change merely
by switching between locutionary modalities.
`p`

`p.
The takeaway from this discussion in the
internalism/externalism setting is that conceptual
roles have a linguistic priority over and against
both lexical and physical realizers, and the
scope for things inside and outside of language
to play (or not play) such roles varies with
context.  I have introduced these issues via
tool artifacts (like corkscrews) but would be
closer to the spirit of the CRS internalism/externalism
debate by discussing natural-kind concepts.  Suppose
I am building a sand castle on a beach and ask someone
one of: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:bucket -> Can you bring me a bucket of water? -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:glass -> Can you bring me a glass of water? -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

For (`ref<itm:bucket>;), a reasonable reaction would be a bucket filled
with ocean water; but for (`ref<itm:glass>;) my addressee would probably
infer that I was thirsty, and %-- since salt water is
non-potable %-- was requesting water I could drink.
But `qifirst -> glass of -> water ;; probably figures here just
to establish my intention to drink it: you are
entitled to bring me bottle of water instead.  In
other words, my request has implied content which
in some aspects loosens and in some aspects restricts
the conceptual scope of semantic entries in my utterance.
Thus oceans are composed of water, and near a beach I can
say: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> The ocean is over there. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> The water is over there. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> You can see the ocean from here. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> You can see the water from here. -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

Each pair is almost identical.  But ocean-water ceases to
fall under the conceptual role of `q.water` when we are in
the context of drinking things instead of the context
of geography.  This suggests that water does not `q.mean`
`htwoo; or other saline or non-saline water: the meaning
is not fixed to any particular chemical composition but
adapts to the situational context, including what the
water is used for %-- e.g. as a drink or as a binder
for a sand castle.
`p`

`p.
The most-discussed `q.water` analysis in the literature is
less earthly than this: Putnam's `q.twin earth` argument
about a planet whose substance (with chemical
makeup) XYZ functionally indisinguishable
from our (`htwoo;) water.  Externalists and internalists
use this thought-experiment to express their
differences as disagreements over
whether twin-earthers' XYZ concept is the same as our
`htwoo; concept.  For the latter, as the basic account
goes, XYZ plays the same conceptual role in their lifeworld
as `htwoo; plays in ours, so it is the same concept;
for the former, the concepts designate different
material substances (even if twin-earthers don't know
this) so they can't mean the same thing, even if
there is some sort of analogy or resemblance between
them (concepts can be analogous or similar while still
being different concepts).
`p`

`p.
Before making a case for one alternative here over the
other, let me note the following: it is unfortunate
that the case-study is formulated in terms of XYZ vs.
`htwoo;, because at the level of molecular composition
it is hard for us to conceive that XYZ is
`i.really` indistinguishable from water.  After all,
our conceptual understanding of water includes things
like electrolysis %-- if XYZ does not emit hydrogn
and oxygen when electricallly charged under certain
controlled conditions, it is not behaving like water
and can not be (even internalistically) construed as
conforming to our concept of water.  Of course, we are
free to expand our water-concept, just as we contract
it when switching from geology/geography to drinking.
But here we expand it with full recognition that
finer-grained conceptual distinctions are possible,
just that there are many contexts where they are
unnecessary.
`p`

`p.
We do not need to contemplate far-fetched twin-earth
scenarios to see this in practice: here on earth
we have deuterium water which is chemically different
from normal water (but both have the `htwoo; signature,
although heavy water is also described as `dtwoo;).
We are free to let `q.X` mean normal hydrogen,
`q.Y` mean deuterium ions, and `q.Z` mean oxygn, so
XYZ becomes what chemists call HDO %-- semi-heavy water.
Most people would probably say that HDO is just
a kind of water, and so can be subsumed under the
concept `q.water`/, but this is not conclusive.
In reality, I don't think the English community has
needed to establish whether  `q.water` should mean
ordinary `htwoo; or should include variations
containing different hydrogen isotopes
%-- whether heavy and semi-heavy and other variants
of water should be considered `q.water` or some other
concepts.
`p`

`p.
In practice, a fraction of ocean water has deuterium,
which might argue for `q.water` subsuming heavy water
%-- we don't point to the ocean and say: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> The water and the Deuterium Dioxide is over there. -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

But this can alternatively be explained by the principle
that referring to an impure sample of a substance is still
a valid use of the concept: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl ->> Here's a glass of water (even though
tap water is mixed with flouride). -> --- -> Here's a glass of water. -> rol ;;
`sentenceItem;  `swl ->> Bing cherries are dark red (even though
the stem is brown). -> --- -> Bing cherries are dark red. -> rol ;;
`sentenceList`

|.|

In the second case, we can validly call something red
even if something less than its whole surface shows a red
color.  Applying a similar rule, we can call a solution
`q.water` if there are only `q.sufficiently small`
amounts of solutes.  Clearly we use `q.water` to designate
many substances other than pure `htwoo;.  I can
think of two options for explaining that semantically:
(1) Salt water, tap water, distilled water, (semi)
heavy water, etc., are all different kinds of water, but
our coarser `q.water` concept subsumes them all (in
most contexts).
(2)  There is only one water concept, pure `htwoo;,
but impure samples of liquid that are mostly water
can be called `q.water` by the same principle that a
mostly red-colored object can be called just `q.red`/.
`p`

`p.
The second option has a common-sensical appeal because
it fits a succinct `q.concepts as natural kinds`
paradigm but does not venture too far from
normal language use %-- that `q.red`
actually means `q.mostly red` is a pattern common
with many nouns and adjectives (someone can be
`i.bald` with a bit of hair; I can point
to a turkey burger made with bread crumbs and
spices and say `q.that's turkey`/; I can
tell someone listening to Keny Arkana's song
`q.Indignados` `q.that's French`/, although some of
the lyrics are Spanish).   However, the `q.mostly
water` reading has a couple of problems: first,
what about cases like a `q.glass of water` where
`q.mostly water` is not `q.mostly` enough to drink?
And, second, why can't we refer to plasma, say %-- which
is 92\% water %-- as water?  This is not just a
matter of numbers: the dead sea water is much
less pure than plasma in the hospital (in terms of
percentage `htwoo; in solution) yet we are authorized
to call the former `q.water` but not the latter.
This certainly seems to be a matter of conceptual roles
%-- plasma occupies a certain place in our
conceptual systems about blood and medicine (largely
because it plays a specific role in biology
and medicine) which does not fit the profile
of `q.water`/, while the stuff in lakes
`i.does` fit that profile, even if the lakes are
hypersaline.  Blood fits a conceptual ecosystem where
we are not tempted to subsume it under the concept
`i.water`/, whereas our conceptualization of
lakes pulls in the opposite direction %-- even
though by purity the water in Gaet'ale Pond in
Ethiopia is apparently not much more
watery than blood.  Our disposition to
either contract or dilate the sense of `q.water`
seems to be determined by context %-- by the conceptual
role water plays in different context %-- rather than
by actual hydrological properties.
`p`

`p.
What about the hypothetical twin-earth XYZ that
Putnam imagines is indistinguishable from
our `htwoo;?  Well, for this hypoyhsis to
even make sense we have to assume that XYZ is
scientifically indistinguishable from water,
which is a matter not just of pure `htwoo; but
of all solutions and deuterium- or triterium-related
variants of water, and so forth.  As a thought experiment,
where we are free to conceive almost anything, this is not
impossible.  Let's imagine that there is an undiscovered
subatomic particle that on some planets clings to
atomic nuclei without affecting them in almost any
way.  We can call nuclei harboring these particles
`q.twin nuclei`/, so hydrogen becomes `q.twin hydrogen`/,
oxygen becomes `q.twin oxygn`/, and presumably
water becomes `q.twin water`/.  This twin water would
essentilly retrace the the compositional structure of
water %-- since it would have to form (and unform, under
electrolysis) just like `q.our` water.  If we plug this
`q.twin water` into Putnam's scnario, I can't see why
we don't just call this a variant kind of water,
water with some extra (but observationally negligible)
particles, just like heavy water is water with
extra neutrons.
`p`

`p.
This does not do perfect justice to `q.twin earth`
discussions, because I am describing `q.twin` water
as something whose composition is almost identical to
`q.our` water.  In the original story, `q.twater` is
XYZ, which as written suggests something whose
physical constituents are much different than water, even
if all propensities that influence our `q.water`
conceptualizations are exactly the same as with our water.
But something compositionally different than
water `i.can't` be functionally identical to water,
at least if any of the actions we can take that reveal
water's composition come out different.  In short,
whatever XYZ are, they must have a capability to
`i.become` hydrogen and oxygen, because XYZ's emulating
water means it emits hydrogen and oxygen under
electrolysis.  Meanwhile there is no action that could
`q.release` the `q.X` (or whatever) because
that would also behaviorally differ from water.
So XYZ would differ from water only insofar as in its
`q.unobserved` states it can float around as something
without hydrogen or oxygen but, whenever subject to
actions that cause water proper to emit these gasses,
it would somehow conjure them up in exactly the same
patterns as water (which actually `i.is` composed of
hydrogen and oxygen) does.
`p`

`p.
By dictum, then, XYZ is not actually composed of
hydrogen and oxygen, but whatever it `i.is` composed
of can act as `i.as if` it `i.does` contain these gasses
so as to emit them.  In that case I'd question the
argumentative force of claiming that XYZ does not
contain hydrogen and oxygen to begin with.  We are asked
to believe that XYZ is made up of some
ethereal non-hydrogen and non-oxygen that can
nevertheless become hydrogen and oxygen whenever it
is in the physical states wherein water that `i.is` made
of hydrogen and oxygen will release them.  I am inclined
to say that this is just another way of being made of
hydrogen and oxygen.  After all, atoms are not little
ping-pong balls: what we picture as a water molecule
is actually apparently much more ethereal, suspended in
quantum indeterminacy.  I take it there is some
`Shrodinger; equation for a water molecule, and only
when the `q.wave function` collapses %-- say, by
our observing the water subject to electrolysis %--
do we actually get hydrogen or oxygen atoms.  So
`q.our` water isn't really `q.composed` of hydrogen or
oxygen in its pure quantum state.  Maybe XYZ
`q.collapses` to hydrogen or oxygen in different
ways than earthly water (but with no way to
measure the difference), but this is still not
divergent enough that for me to feel compelled
to call XYZ anything other than some variant
form of water.
`p`

`p.
Of course, I am assuming that twin earthers have
`i.the same` water-concept that we do,
`i.in all respects`/.  Maybe a more faithful
review would consider that twin earthers might have a
related but more primitive water-concept than ours
%-- maybe some subset of our concept in terms of
the scientific knowledge embedded in our concept.
Before we earthers knew about hydrogen, oxygen,
or electrolysis, the behavior of water under
electrolysis was not a factor in our concept of water.
So imagine if twin earthers' level of scientific knowledge
was akin to that on earth centuries ago %-- their
XYZ is measurably different from our water, but
they have no experimental or scientific apparatus to
notice the difference.  But this is `i.contingent`/:
the twin earthers `i.could` some day discover
hydrogen and oxygen.  Then, if
XYZ really is not composed of hydrogen and oxygen
(or acts as if composed of them when not in a
nonobservable ethereal state) their scientific theory
of water, and accordingly their conceptualization,
would diverge from ours.
`p`

`p.
We can imagine a non-water XYZ that is water-like enough
to play an identical role to (our) water, but this story
can go in two directions: either XYZ is `i.absolutely`
identical to water, its differences from water so obscure
as to be observationally and causally maningless; or it
has legitimate differences from water that `i.could` be
conceptually significant but in some context are not
(at least not yet).  These are two different thought
experiments.  If some substance is in all respects and
under any conceivable science identical to water, yet
somehow compositionally different from it, I
think the plausible response among normal language communities
would be to extend the concept of water %-- subsuming
XYZ under the concept, analogous to heavy water when it
was discovered.  We are generally prepared to expand the
reach of concepts when there is no compelling reason
not to do so.  Whether a potential expansion takes
hold probably varies by context.  We are %-- a point
that generally fits on the externalist side of the ledger
%-- more willing to accept expansion when the revised
conceptualization would not deviate too far from
a basic alignment of natural kind concepts to
scientifically reasonable classifications.  We can readily
extend `q.water` to `dtwoo; because the two substances are
compositionally very similar.  We are less likely
to accept conceptual mergers when they seem to violate
our natural-kind pictures, even if they
are functionally plausible: we do not accept `q.agave`
as a subconcept of `q.honey`/, even though the two are
physically rather similar and functionally very similar.
Nor does physical form alone drive conceptual
boundaries: we know full well that water vapor
and ice are the same stuff as liquid water, but we
recognize a conceptual distinction between them.
`p`

`p.
But these are not hard and fast rules: we may be
inclined in many contexts to treat frozen-concentrate
juice as conceptually subsumed under `q.juice`
(as in `q.juice on sale`/), and we will often
accept almond milk or cashew milk as `q.milk`/,
despite physical differences which we certainly
acknowledge.  In short, conceptual boundaries
tend to be drawn to honor, albeit without
excess granularity, both physical and functional
factors %-- neither physical/compositional similitude
alone, in the absent of functional resemblance
(see water/ice) tends to earn concept dilation, nor
vice-versa, but a mixture of functional and physical
similarity even with `i.some` differences in both
aspects tend to be likelier drivers of concept-expansion
(see water vs. chlorinated water, or red
wine vs. white wine).  By these rules, expanding
`q.water` to include XYZ %-- if XYZ is functionaly
identical to `i.but` compositionally different from
water %-- would be abnormal, like
expanding `q.milk` to %-- without any qualification %--
include almond milk.  But
these rules are approximate, and on the idiosyncratic
case where XYZ is `i.completely` functionally like
water but (stipulated to be) physically different
(though by functional identity we could not detect
as much), I think the normal `q.conceptual dilation`
rules would side with the functional identity and
ignore the physical differences.
`p`

`p.
On the other hand, if XYZ has real discoverable
differences from water, then the potential exists
for twin earthers' concept of water to
diverge from our own, even if at any point
in time the concepts are identical.  The time
`q.points` don't need to be simultaneous: we can
compare one country's concept of water in the year
1800 with a different county's in the 16th century.
It is plausible that different people at different
times have effectively the same conceptual
attitudes toward concepts that, with the benefit of
hindsight and more science, we know have potential
for differentiation.  I think the mere potential for
differentiation warrants our identifying
conceptual differences even if the parties involved are
not aware of this potential.  I am prepared,
for example, to accept that a child's water-concept
in our time can be different from a medieval
child's water-concept merely by virtue of the modern
child potentially learning about deuterium,
hypersalinity, and other scientific nuances that
complicate the modern conception of water relative
to our forebearers.
`p`

`spsubsectiontwoline.Divorse or Dilate?  On
Widening or Narrowing Concepts`
`p.
We certainly accept that people may have different
understandings of a concept and, on that basis,
may judge that what two people are entertaining are
two different concepts %-- though we may also feel
that they entertain two variations of `i.the same`
concepts.  There's room for most concepts to
`q.diversify`/, subsuming subconcepts and
variations; hence there's room for a concept to
expand (see water to heavy water) without fragmenting.
But sometimes we `i.do` insist on splitting concepts
%-- or, eqivalently, refuse to accept a concept-enlargement
%-- and `i.the reasons for this refusal may be external
to some peoples' use of the concepts`/.  Current
political discourse in the United States, for example, is
driven by turns of phrase that are rather haphazardly
defined: `i.Border Wall`/, `i.Green New Deal`/,
`i.Free Tuition`/, etc.  Suppose a health policy
expert observes that Bernie Sanders's use of the term
`q.Medicare for All` is different from Kamala Harris's.
She may conclude that Sanders's concept
`q.Medicare for All` is different from Harris's
concept %-- and the rationale for this conclusion need
not take into account whether the two candidates are
aware of the differences.  Suppose, as an expert,
she has to mentally track the differences %-- she
has a well-informed judgment that each of the
`q.Medicare for All` plans have different
ramifications due to policy differences;
as a result when discussing `q.Medicare for All` she
needs to note in her own mind which version of that
idea is under discussion at any moment in a discourse.
That is to say, she needs to subsume them
under different concepts.  Moreover, we endorse that she
`i.should` do so, even if she thereby makes a distinction
that the politicans or their supporters themselves
do not realize.  In this kind of case we may defer
to expert opinion when adjudicating a potential
conceptual divorce, even if there is only
minimal differences in the role of the concepts
`visavis; the conceptual systems
of many relevant parties.
`p`

`p.
The possibility that `q.Medicare for All`
may play the same `i.role` in a Sanders supporter's and
a Harris supporter's conceptualizations does
not preclude our judging that they are nonetheless
different concepts %-- if by virtue of
more information and more access to expert
counsel we can understand that there are potential
differences in their conceptualizations that `i.could`
drive the conceptual roles to diverge.  I think this
is analogous to a `q.twin earth XYZ` scenario in that the
thought experiment is set up as if we have access to
expert confirmation that twin earth's
XYZ is not physically the same substance as water.
Projecting from earthly practice, we accordingly
accept that `q.externalist` considerations may need to come
to bear, and `q.XYZ` may need to be classified as a different
concept that water `i.notwithstanding` the lack
of any conceptual role difference between XYZ for
twin earthers as compared to water for us.  This is
consistent with our tolerance for including
factors beyond just conceptual roles in more mundane
circumstances: we accept that sufficiently divergent
notions of `q.Medicare for All` `i.could` be
most appropriately classified as two different concepts.
Such is not mandated %-- we could certainly
describe the Sanders and Harris platform as
`q.two different Medicare for All plans`/, subsuming
them under one concept but acknowldging their
differences %-- as token differences, like the conceptual
difference between this apple and that apple, rather
than concept-differences like apple vs. cherry.
Analogously, we `i.could` subsume XYZ under the concept
`i.water` %-- XYZ being a kind of water insofar as
samples of XYZ (tokens of the XYZ-concept) bear some
physical differences to tokens of ordinary water (like
heavy-water samples do), but we can handle this variation
on a token-token level (analogous to comparing
two apples).  But we can `i.also` split rather than
expand the conceps %-- `i.divorce` rather
than `i.dilate` %-- making XYZ a different concept than
water, just as we can make Sanders supporters' Medicare
for All a different concept that Harris supporters'.
The key point is that our choice of `q.divorce or dilate`
may be driven by factors wholly external to
some concept-bearers' internal concept-uses.
Two different concepts %-- recognized by us as different
%-- may play identical conceptual roles for some people.
`p`

`p.
This stance is at least minimally Externalist in that
I don't insist on internal conceptual-role
similitude being an immovable criteria selecting
`q.dilate` over `q.divorce`/.  We as a language
community can and sometimes should override the tendency
for concepts to expand under role considerations.
As I pointed out earlier, a corkscrew and even a
hammer can sometimes satisfy the role
`q.bottle opener` in specific contexts.  Usually
we distinguish context-specific
conceptual role-playing from general concept dilation
%-- I think this is the gist of Zhaohui Luo's
analysis of `q.situations` and `q.Manifest entries`/.
We can adopt a temporary frame of reference wherein, say,
hammers are bottle openers %-- or in Luo's example
(in a single zoo exhibit) all animals are snakes
%-- without mutating the concepts so
wildly that `q.hammers` become expanded to including
anything that may open a capped bottle, or
`q.snakes` become all animals.  Yet such situational
dilations can recur and eventually spill beyond
their situational guard rails.  In a
vegan cafe I can imagine the staff converging on a
usage that soy, almond, and cashew milks are
collectively called just `q.milk`/.  If veganism becomes
entrenched in some English-speaking community I can similarly
imagine that in their dialect `q.milk` will mean anything
that can be used like milk in a culinary context.
The warrants for such expansions seem to be driven by conceptual
roles %-- situations present `q.slots`/,
like `i.that which opens this bottle` or `i.that which
I pour on cereal`/, and existing concepts tend to
expand to fit these slots.
`p`

`p.
These considerations follow the `i.internalist`
line: we take attitudes based on conceptual role
more than external natural-kinds when adjudicating
conceptual boundaries.  Thus situationally we may
present almond milk and agave to satisfy a request for
milk and honey.  But superimposed on such `q.centrifugal`
tendency for concepts to expand into `q.under-lexified`
conceptual niches we have a counter tendency to
question conceptual uses where functional
resemblance strays `i.too far` from common sense.
Someone may accept agave in lieu of honey, or a hammer
as a bottle opener, in the context of how one
situation plays out; but they are less likly
to accept these uses becoming entrenched, compared to,
say, refiguring `q.milk` to include almond and
cashew milk.  And our hesitation to
accept concept-expansion in these latter kinds
of cases seems to implicitly look beyond
conceptual roles %-- we may insist on limiting
concept dilations even if there are many people for
whom there will never be situations where the
differences between concept referents, over and
above functional resemblance, would be important.
In short, even if a community could do
just fine with some dialect idiosyncracy that
ignores a conceptual distinction we would ordinarily
make, we don't tend to take this as evidence
that our multiple concepts can be merged into one more
diverse concept.
`p`

`p.
Of course we `i.can` merge concepts, and the fact that
many people can live their lives without a conceptual
coarsening may render such merger likelier, but
it seems we evaluate potential mergers more by
reference to entire speech-communities, not
isolated parts.  Note that I am specifically talking here
about merging or splitting concepts, not word-senses or
lexemes or any purely linguistic artifacts.
Certainly we have variegated `q.water` concepts
%-- salt, tap, distilled, heavy %-- but we have an
overarching water concept that includes these as
subconcepts.  We can make a conscious decision to modify
concept/subconcept relations %-- which is
different from changing how concepts are mappped to
lexemes.  So I take it that Conceptual Role Semantics
prioritizes role factors in drawing concept/subconcept
relations and boundaries, and the consequence is a
mostly Internalist intuitive model: we should
accept concept maps where concepts are mostly
drawn together when there is a functional resemblance
between their roles: our concept/subconcept renderings
should witness and help us exploit functional analogies.
`p`

`p.
At the same time, however, I think we instinctively
project notions of conceptual role outward from
individual people or subcommunities to the social
totality.  Even if technically distinct Medicare for
All plans play similar conceptual roles in different
voters' conceptions, we understand that such similarity
may break down as we expand the community outward.  Sanders
and Haris supporters don't live on thier own islands.
There are factors outside their own minds that weigh
on whether their functionally similar Medicare for
All concepts are indeed `i.the same concept` from the
larger communiy's point of view.  But these external
factors are not necessarily `i.extramental`/: we
can zoom outside the conceptual patterns of one
subcommunity and argue that conceptual differences
appear in the overall speech community that supersede
functional resemblance in some subcommunity.
Conceptual roles are not solipsistic: the role of
the concept Medicare for All for a Sanders supporter
is not just a role in `i.her` mind, but it becomes a role
in `i.our` minds if we dialogically interact
with her.
`p`

`p.
Insofar as people can make inferences about other peoples'
conceptual role `q.system` %-- we can figure out
the role which a concept plays in somone else's
mind, to some approximation, even if analogous
concepts play a different role in our own minds
%-- conceptual roles are not private affairs; they
have some public manifestation and there is a need
for collective reconciliation of role differences,
just as we need to identify when different people
are using the same words in different ways and
use lexical conventions to diminish the
chance of confusion.  To the extent that they have this public
dimension, conceptual roles are
not `i.internal`/.  But `q.externalism` in this sense is
waranted because we want to look philosophically
at entire speech or cognitive communities %-- it is not
automatically a philosophy of conceptual content
being external to `q.mind in general`/.  Conceptual
differences that could `i.potentially` become
publicly observable from the vantage point
of the `i.entire` cognitive community warrant
consideration for conceptual divorce over dilation
%-- overriding similar roles in some `i.part`
of the community.
`p`

`p.
In the case of XYZ, insofar as the twin earth cognitive
community and our own could `i.potentially` become part
of a single overarching cognitive community, we have
potential grounds for drawing comparisons
between water and XYZ.  Merely by contemplating
their planet here on earth we are performatively
drawing twin earthers into our cognitive community.
By postulating that twin earthers
think about XYZ the same way that we think about water %--
and that we know this %-- we implicitly assume
that their conceptual role patterns are public observables
in the context of our own community.  If conceptual
roles are observable, then there is a concept
of a conceptual role: pundits can
conceptually analyze how `q.Medicare for All` plays
identical conceptual roles for Sanders and Harris
supporters even if the candidates' plans are
consequentially different.  But this merely says
that there are latent differences in two people's
conceptual roles that they themselves may not actually
experience.  The public facet of conceptual roles
complicates the notion of conceptual role similarity
%-- two people's patterns of conceptual roles may
be observably different as public phenoemena
even if they lack resources to realize the
difference.  Conceptual roles are therefore external
to individual minds %-- but this is by scoping
outside individual minds to holistic cognitive
communities who can publicly observe our
cognitive tendencies.  We are still reasoning
`q.internalistically` in the sense of considering
cognitive patterns at the scale of an overall
cognitive community.
`p`

`p.
In short, I will take the mantra of an `q.Externalist`
when passing from individual minds and subcommunities
to the public nature of conceptual roles and
overaching cognitive communities.  Once we get
to the maximal possible community, however,
I am inclined to revert to Internalism: if there
is no broadening of communal scope that could
make putative external diffrences meaningful to
`i.anyone's` conceptual roles, I see no reason to
account for `i.these` erstwhile externalities in  a
theory of concepts.  If XYZ has `i.some`
not-water-like qualities that a sufficiently large
cognitive community could confront %-- even if
XYZ-conceptual-role and earthly-water-conceptual-role
is identical for the two isolated communities %--
I am happy to accept that twin earthers' XYZ-concept
is a different concept than earthers' water-concept.
Similarly, I accept that Sanders supporters'
Medicare for All concept may be a different concept
than Harris supporters'.  But in both cases I accept
concept splitting to ovrride role-similarity because
I believe in an overarching cognitive community
which has an interest in detecting differences or
potential differences in conceptual roles qua
public observables, which transcendes our own internal
awareness of what our conceptual roles entail.
The fact that earthers and twin-earthers might never
`q.discover` a water/XYZ difference is a contingent
fact, not an essential structure in policing
conceptual maps.   When establishing how
we should consider redrawing thse maps, we should
work from the picture of an overarching comunity %-- that
can subsume isolated communities %-- as an abstract
posit; the parts of the twin earth story that imply
earthers and twin earthers could never actually discover
their differences are not, I think, compelling as
intrinsic features of the analysis.  In short, if
water and XYZ have some potentially observable
differences, then we need to proceed as the community which is
aware that these differences exist and that therefore, for us,
water and XYZ need different conceptual slots.
The only analysis then is how to reconcile the fact
that we have multiple conceptual slots whereas twin earthers
(and earthers who have not read Hillary Putnam) have just one.
`p`

`p.
But if we take a `i.maximal` cognitive community
%-- the sum total of earthers and twin
earthers and philosophers %-- this community `i.does`
distinguish XYZ from water (surrely XYZ plays a different
role in Putnam's mind than water).  And we should
scope to the maximal community when determining whether
smaller communities' conceptual roles are
truly identical, because conceptual roles are, in part,
potential public obervables for any possible supercommunity.
`p`

`p.
On the other hand, if XYZ is so much like
water that `i.no` community would
`i.ever` have reason to contrast twin-earthers's
XYZ-conceptual-role with our water-conceptual-role, then
I think these roles are not just
`i.internally` identical for each (twin-) earther, but
`i.publicly` identical for any conceivable
cognitive community for whom public observations
of (twin-) earthers' conceptualizations are
consequential givens.  And in `i.that` case
I think XYZ is the same concept as water
notwithstanding putative compositional differences.
`p`

`p.
The whole idea that conceptual roles can be
`i.public` complicates the Internalist/Externalist
distinction, because each person's conceptual
patterns can be evaluated from a vantage point
external to `i.their` mind but still within
the proclivities of a `q.maximal` cognitive community.
Conceptual roles are not private to each person, but
are private inclinations that get reshaped,
corrected, influenced, or reinterpreted by a
larger community.  If we understand conceptual
roles to include the totality not just of each
person's conceptual role attitudes but the totality
of how these attitudes are observed by others,
then we should consider that concepts are not
`q.external` to the `i.maximal` cognitive comunity.
Externalism about `i.individual` minds can be
wrapped inside Internalism at the `i.maximal`
inter-cognitive level.
`p`

`p.
But, complicating matters further, the maximal
community's observations of conceptual-role attitudes
is often driven by at least our `i.beliefs` about
external (i.e., extramental, natural-kind)
criteria.  For example, some companies
want to rechristen `q.corn syrup` as `q.corn sugar`/,
to make it seem more like a sugar-subconcept.  Meanwhile,
some dairy companies want laws restricting the use of
`q.milk` for vegan products.  In both cases our larger
community has a chance to weigh the proper conventions
for how our conceptual maps should be drawn.
As I argued earlier, both functional and naturalistic
criteria play a role in such deliberations.  We are
poised to distinguish transient situation-specific
roles %-- that one time someone used a hammer
as a bottle opener %-- from functional
parallels that stretch across many contexts.
Within the parameters of that contrast, we are
receptive to redrawing maps on role
criteria %-- allowing milk to subsume
vegan milk-substitutes, for instance.  But this
tendency is balanced by a respect for some
notion of coherent natural kinds %-- the
distinct biological properties of vegan milks
work against a `i.maximal` community subsuming
them under `q.milk` outside of special contexts.
`p`

`p.
Both the Externalist and Internalist points of
view have some traffic in the considerations that
cognitive communities bring to bear on
which conceptual maps should be enorsed by convention.
Because ad-hoc conceptual roles
can be established for particular situations,
we can be conservative about `i.conventionalizing`
concept maps driven by functional correspondances
too far removed from (what we think
to be) scintifically endorsed, natural-kind
boundaries.  In other words, I think we `i.do` and
`i.should` allow `q.naturalistic` considerations
to be a factor in what concept maps we endorse.
But this is not a claim about Externalism as
a philosophical paradigm shaping how we
should construe the triangulation between
mind, world, and language, as a matter of
metaphysical ideology.  Rather I believe
that `q.externalist` factors should and do come
to bear on the deliberations `i.internal`
to cognitive communities' (sometimes but
not always explicit) evaluations of how to draw
concept and subconcept boundaries and relations
%-- when to split concepts and when to dilate them.
Dilate-or-divorce options are pulled by
both externalist and internalist considerations,
sometimes in competing ways.
`p`

`p.
As as case-study, the wording `q.corn sugar` %-- which implies a
`q.redistricting` wherein the concept `q.corn syrup` becomes
part of the territory `q.sugar` %-- may be credible
on purely biochemical grounds.  But our community may feel
that there is enough functional difference between sugar
and corn syrup from a commercial and nutritional sense to
reject a proposed merger %-- here functional considerations
trump natural-kind ones.  Conversely, the community may be
sympathetic to claims that milk substitutes should be labeled
to clearly indicate how they are are not `i.literally` milk
%-- here natural-kind considerations trump functional ones.
`p`

`p.
If we consider language %-- and communally-endorsed
conceptualizations %-- evolving in practice, then,
by light of my claims until here, there is material
for both Externalist and Internalist readings.
This perhaps leaves room for a theory which
accepts that both are partially true %-- each
being logically founded under consideration of two
different aspects of how concepts evolve.  I will
explore this possibility further, but first I
want to shore up my account of conceptual roles
themselves.
`p`

`p.
One complication I have
glossed so far is that `i.functional` roles in an
enactive and `q.pragmatic` (in the everyday-world
sense) spheres are not `i.ipso facto` the
same as either conceptualizations
(conceptual-role-attitudes) or lexicosemantic
conventions.  These three are interrelated, but we
need social and cognitive practices to get
situational understandings entrenched in
language and in communal concept-maps.
Without a theory of this process, to speak of
functional roles like `i.hammer` for
`i.bottle opener` is not a substitute for
speaking of conceptual roles `i.per se`/.
How to properly link `q.functionality` in an
enactive quotidian sense %-- the data that
various natural and man-made artifacts are
used by people for concrete tasks, and
we often talk about this %-- to the cognitive
realm of concepts (and their boundaries and
subconcept relations)?  This is the main theme
of Section 2.  I will however conclude the present
section by reviewing a useful critique
of the conventional Externalism/Internalism dialectic.
I will focus in on Orlin Vakarelov's `q.Interface
Theory of Meaning`/, developed over several recent papers,
which I will also (somewhat indirectly) use as a
kind of metatheoretic guide when presenting my own
thoretical attachments later on.
`p`

`spsubsectiontwoline.Orlin Vakarelov's Interface Theory of Maning`
`p.
Vakarelov's theory (which I'll abbreviate to ITM)
both critiques and suggests ways around the
Externalism/Internalism impasse:

`quote,
An externalist theory focuses on constraints outside of
the user of the informational state. Particularly, it focuses
on the relation between the informational state
and the sources or object of the information. The meat
of the semantic connection derives from some nomic (or
teleonomic) connection between the source system and
the information medium (receiver) system. The focus
of semantics for an externalist theory is the determination
of the way the world is. ... An internalist theory, on the
other hand, considers
as the primary constraint of meaning what the information
state does for the user. The model of the internalist
account is not reference fixation and fact determination,
but message interpretation. The question that an internalist
asks is not `i.what m means`/, but `i.what m means to a
given user`/. Of course, for `i.m` to be informative about the
world, it better be sufficiently correlated with a source,
but this is not a constitutive condition of the meaning
of `i.m`/. It is a condition of a good interpretation system. ...
One strategy for reconciling externalism and internalism is to
take a hybrid account of meaning/content.  Such hybrid
theories are motivated by an observation that external
or internal considerations are not sufficiently fine
grained. ... Such hybrid theories of meaning
have targeted cognitive information media %-- languages,
mental states (beliefs), etc.  This analysis of
meaning cannot easily transfer to the domain of dynamical
semantic information.  In the case of dynamical semantic information, the
externalist and internalist conceptions of meaning collapse
into a single notion.  The reason for this is the codetermination
of macro-state structure of informational
systems.
`cite<[pages 13-14]OrlinVakarelov>;
`quote`

He then presents his ITM alternative (for terminological
clarification, his symbol $M$ roughly matches what I have called
`q.cognitive frames`/, and $S$ roughly matches our
environing situations):

`quote,
It follows that neither an external relation between
$M$ and $S$, nor an internal function of `q.selecting conditional
readiness states` is sufficient to provide a general
notion of meaning, for they don't even fix the syntax of
the information system independently.  To specify the
meaning of a state `i.m` we must do something different.
What does $M$ really do in the information system?
It acts as an `i.interface` between the (external) world
and the control system. It structures influences to allow
focused purposeful control. If any sense of significance
can be given to a particular state `i.m` of $M$, it must
be related to this interface function. The significance
of `i.m` is neither that it tracks something external nor
that it can affect the control mechanisms of the system,
but that it can connect one to the other. ... Let us go
back to the observation that the definition
collapses the external and internal conception of meaning.
Specifying the differential interface function of a
state requires looking at the entire system/environment
complex.  We can think of the datum state `i.m` as participating
in a process of interaction where causal effects
from the environment are channeled through the internal
$M$-$P$ control pathway to produce actions, which actions
modify the system's behavior, and which in turn
changes the state of the environment (including the relations
between the system and other external systems).
`cite<[pages 15-16]OrlinVakarelov>;
`quote`

Finally he extends this definition of `i.meaning`
toward language itself:

`quote,
The story gets more interesting when ...
the system utilizes different sub-systems that act
as information media.  The system may have [different] media, each
with different roles and interface connections.  Some media
may be connected to different external systems or
different aspects of the same systems, others may interface
with other media, yet others may be connected
with effectors or control the states of other media, etc.
When the system is organized as a complex network of
information media, complex interface (sub-)functions
can emerge. Some can depend almost exclusively on
external connections to outside sources, others can be
analyzed entirely in terms of their control role or effects
on other media. I conjecture that the canonical
examples of information media that shape many of our
intuitions about semantics are media that exist (within
an information system) as only one of a large network
of other information media that jointly control the system's
behavior. Thus, to take correspondence theories
of meaning as an example, it is tempting to say that
the word `sq.chair` means a property of external objects.
Thus, in the expression, `q.This is a chair`/, the meaning
is given by some fact in the world that the object depicted
by the indexical has the property of chairhood.
In an information system using language we can analyze
this idea in a different way. The language medium,
whose datum may be some structural equivalent to the
expression `q.This is a chair`/, interacts with other nonlinguistic
media connected to perception, allowing the
system to identify and interact with patterns in the
world that can be clustered through some data state
of some internal media. To make Fodor happy, we can
assume that there is a single medium that gets in an information
state uniquely correlated with chairhood %--
a kind of a concept of `q.chair`/.  The language system, in
this picture, is not interfaced with the world (or some
abstract realm of propositions).  It is interfaced with
other information media. The properties of the interface
relations look a lot like the properties that a correspondence
semantics may have, but these interface relations
do not capture the true interface roles of the language
datums for the information system. To determine the
true interface role, we need to link all local interfaces
and see how the entire complex participates in the purposeful
behavior.  `cite<[page 17]OrlinVakarelov>;
`quote`
`p`

`p.
Interestingly, Vakarelov speaks not of `q.prelinguistic` cognition but
of `q.precognitive` systems.  This is partly, I belive,
because Vakarelov wants to understand cognition as
adaptation: `q.Nature, in its nomic patterns,
offers many opportunities for data systems that can be
given semantic significance, it offers ubiquitous potential
datums, but it does not offer any well-defined and
complete data sets` `cite<[page 4]OrlinVakarelov>;.
As I read it, Vakarelov conceives
cognitive systems as dynamic systems that try to adapt
to other dynamic systems %-- these latter being the environments
where we (taking humans as example cognitive systems) need
to act purposefully and intelligently.  The `q.nomic patterns`
are latent in our surroundings, and not created by intellect.
So `i.this` kind of worldly order lies `q.outside` cognition
in an ontological sense; it is not an order which exists (in itself)
in our minds (though it may be mirrored there).  Consciousness
comports to an `q.extramentally` ordered world.
However, `q.precognitive` does not necessarily mean `q.extramental`/:
there is a difference between being `i.aware` of structural
regularities in our environment, which we can
perhaps deem a form of pre-cognitive mentality, and trying
to `i.interpret` these regularities for practical
benefit (and maybe a subjective desire for knowledge).
`p`

`p.
When distinguishing `q.cognitive` from `q.precognitive`/, however,
we should also recognize the different connotations that
the term `q.cognitive` itself has in diffrent academic communities.
In the context of Cognitive Linguistics, the
term takes on an interpretive and phenomenological
dimension which carries noticeably different implications in the
`q.semantics of the theory` than in, say, conventional AI
research.  Vakarelov's strategy is to approach `i.human` cognition
as one manifstation of structured systems which we can visualize
as concentric circle, each ring implying greater sophistication
and more rigorous criteriology than its outer neighbor:

`quote,
What is the function of cognition? By answering this question it
becomes possible to investigate what are the simplest cognitive systems. It addresses the question by treating
cognition as a solution to a design problem. It defines a nested sequence of design problems: (1) How can a system
persist? (2) How can a system affect its environment to improve its persistence? (3) How can a system utilize better
information from the environment to select better actions? And, (4) How can a system reduce its inherent informational
limitations to achieve more successful behavior? This provides a corresponding nested sequence of
system classes: (1) autonomous systems, (2) (re)active autonomous systems, (3) informationally controlled autonomous
systems (autonomous agents), and (4) cognitive systems.
`cite<[page 83]VakarelovAgent>;
`quote`

`quote,
The most rudimentary design problem begins here: if
there is cognition, there must be a system. Without a
condition allowing a system to exist as an entity discernible
from its environment and persisting sufficiently
long as that same entity to allow qualification of its
dynamical behavior, the question of cognition does
not arise. The first design question that must be examined
is: What allows systems to persist as individual entities?
More specifically: For which of those systems that
persist is a capacity of cognition relevant?
`cite<[page 85]VakarelovAgent>;
`quote`

But this intuition that human cognition can thematically
extend out to other `q.cognitive systems` and then
other structured systems %-- out of which `i.cognition`
emerges by adding on criteria: is the system autonomous;
reactive; information-controlled %-- suggests we
are dealing with a different concept than in
Cognitive Linguistics or Cognitive Phenomenology.
For Vakarelov, `q.cognition, like most
other biological categories, defines a gradation, not a
precise boundary %-- thus, we can at best hope to define
a direction of gradation of a capacity and a class of
systems for which the capacity is relevant; [and] cognition
is an operational capacity, that is, it is a condition on
mechanisms of the system, not merely on the behavior
of the system %-- to say that a system is cognitive is to say
something general about how the system does something,
not only what it does` (p. 85).  Conversely,
the qualities that make `q.grammar`/, say, `q.Cognitive`
seem uniquely human: our sociality in the complexity
of social arrangements and cultural transmission;
our `q.theory of other minds`/.  Certainly
animals can have society, culture, and emapthy,
but the human mind evidently takes these to a
qualitatively higher level,
making language `i.qua` cognitive system possible.
`p`

`p.
This argument does not challenge Vakarelov's
programme directly, but perhaps it shifts the emphasis.
Our cognition may be only
one example of cognitive systems %-- which in turn
are examples of more general
autonomous/reactive/information-controlled systems
%-- but there may still be distinct phenomenological and
existential qualities to how `i.we` achieve
cognition, certainly including human language.
I think there are several distinct features
we can identify with respect to `i.human`
`q.cognitive frames`/, which call for a
distinct pattern of analysis compared to generic `q.$M$`
systems, in Vakarelov's terms.
`p`

`p.
I'll mention the following:
`description,
`item ->> Multi-Scale Situationality ;;  We understand situations as
immediate contexts for our thoughts and actions, but we also
recognize situations as parts of
larger contxts, and connected to each other in chains stretching
into past and future.  For example, as a train pulls into a
subway station, our immediate situation may be needing to
determine if this is the train we need to board.  But this is
linked to the larger situation of traveling to our destination;
and situations are strung together as enactive episodes: once
I determine which is the correct train, I need to enact the process
of boarding and getting comfortable on the train, then get
ready to reverse the process and disembark at my
station.  All of this inter-situational orchestration
can be planned and facilitated, to the degree that
multiple people are involved, through language.

`item ->> Conversational Frames ;; Our `i.cognitive` frames modeling
situations and our immediate environments
include models of ongoing `i.conversations`/.
I think this is an example of what Vakarelov calls
`q.sub-systems`/: within our intellectual `q.systems`
that track outside reality, there is a part
that specifically tracks what people are saying
%-- so that we can take note of what they believe,
how they are using different words, what they
consider or would deem relevant to the current
topic (or situation) %-- all of which
helps us use language to reason through situations
intersubjectively.  I will
discuss the architecture of conversation
frames more in Section 3.

`item ->> Conceptual Roles ;; We have, I believe, a
unique ability to fuse perceptual and conceptual
detail in understanding situations.  That is, we
identify objects perceptually while also
placing them in a contextual matrix, where
functional properties may be foregrounded above
directly perceptual ones.  If, say, we hear someone ask
for a glass of water and see someone else hand her one,
we understand the glass not only through its
sensate qualities %-- or even through our
pragmatic/operational interpretations, like believing
that the solidity of the glass
prevents the water from leaking out %-- but we also
intrpret people's practical intensions and mental
attitudes.  We infer that the first person was thirsty and
the second cooperated by providing her with water to quench her
thirst.  Interpreting the situation at that
interpersonal level, not just at a sensory/perceptual
or a force-dynamic level, enables us to understand situational
variations, like responding to requests for a
`i.glass` of water by bringing a `i.bottle`/.
`description`

In short, to undrstand `i.how` our cognitive frames
align with environing patterns we have to understand
the role language plays in this process: a role
which can be intersubjective, empathic, context-sensitive,
defined by conceptual substitutions and interpersonal cues
as much as by rigid rules.
`p`

`p.
And yet, I think Vakarelov's larger point remains in
force: we need to get beyond both Externalism and
Internalism in the sense that we need to get
beyond a debate as to whether `i.words` have
`q.intramental` or `q.extramental` `i.meanings`/.
For instance, we need to think past an apparent
choice between deciding that the word `q.water`
has a `i.meaning` which is either
intramental (determined by the sum of each person's
beliefs and dispositions about water) or
extramental (determined by how our water-experiences
are structured, even beyond our knowldge,
by the physical nature of water).  In place of
either option, we should say that the meaning of the word
`i.water` %-- or `i.chair`/, in Vakarelov's example
%-- depends on all the cognitive systems interacting
with linguistic understanding.  The word or concept
does not exist in our `q.language-processing system`
in isolation; so its meaningis not
just `i.linguistic` meaning but how word-tokens
and concept-instances become passed from system to system.
`p`

`p.
Insofar as we have a token of the word `i.water`
%-- presumably tied to a concept-instance %--
the specific fact of our hearing the word is joined
in with a plethora of other perceptual and
rational events.  Say, we hear someone ask for water,
and soon after see someone bring her a glass.
We instinctively connect our perceptual
apprehension of the glass of water with the word
heard spoken before, and we presumably remain
vaguely aware of the situation as things
unfold %-- if we see her drink from
the glass, we connect this to our
memory of her asking for water, indicating thirst, and
then getting a glass in response.  We do not need to
track these affairs very attentively %-- it's not like
we should or need to stare at her intently while
she drinks %-- but it fades into the
background rationality that we tend to attribute
to day-to-day affairs.  Her glass of water %--
how it continues to serve a useful purpose, how
she and maybe others interact withbit %-- becomes a stable
if rather mundane part of our current situation.
`p`

In Vakarelov's words,

`quote,
To determine whether a particular macro-state of $S$ is
informationally relevant, i.e. whether it is differentially
significant for the purposeful behavior of the system, we
must trace the dynamical trajectories of the system and
determine ... whether the microstate
variation within the macro-states is insignificant
for the purposeful behavior.... Let us call such
macro-states `i.informationally stable`/.

An intrinsic dimension of situational models,
surely, is that they recognize the
relatively stable patterns of situations:
a glass placed on a table will typically remain there until
someone moves it.  Situations are, in this sense,
large compilations of distinct quanta of relative stability:
in a dining context, every glass or plate or knife,
every chair or table, every seated person, is an island
of relative stability, whose state will change
gradually if at all.   So a large part of
our cognitive processing can be seen as recognizing and
tracking these stabilities.  Stability is the
underlying medium through which situational models are
formed.

Utlimately, many cognitive systems contribute to such models:
quanta of stability lie in the cross-hairs of multiple
cognitive modalities.  So we connect the water spoken about
to water in a glass.  If we have our own glass we connect
both the linguistic and visual content to the tactile
feel of the glass and the kinaesthetic intentionality
exercised as we pick it up.  We can imagine concepts like
`i.this water` pinging between these various cognitive
registers.

I take Vakerlov's ITM model
(or metatheory, maybe) as saying that we should look
at `i.meaning` through the interstices between
systems, not as some semiotic accounting summed up
either `q.inside` or `q.outside` the mind.  The meaning
of a broad concept like `i.water` is subsidiary to the
meaning of more context-bound concepts like `i.glasss of water`/,
`i.body of water`/, `i.running water`/: and
to excavate conceptual meanings in these
situationally anchored cognitions we need to think
through the `i.conceptual roles` we instinctively
pin onto the concept-exemplified: whether manifest as
an element of language or perception/enaction, or both.
