`section.Conclusion`

`p.
Without reducing linguistic `i.performance` to language qua
field of propositional expression, and without collapsing linguistic meaning
to a computable/propositional fragment, we can still allow
interpretive-phenomenological and formal/mathematical perspectives to co-exist.
In the theory I have sketched, Cognitive Schema summarize lived, situated
judgments and intentions that (in concrete form) are not `q.computable`
(again with the caveat that our mostly science-driven worldview may imply
that all reality is `q.computable` in some infinitely-powerful computation;
I understand `q.computability` to terminologically exclude
such a purely speculative level of capacity).
However, our propensity to call up certain construals rather than others is triggered by
linguistic formations, and in broad outline the catalog of these triggers,
and their compositional structure, can be formalized (and even
used to improve formal systems, like programming languages).  The
challenge is to advocate for this co-existence without implying
that formal systems, and mathematically provable system-properties,
are the only kind of research tools which have scientific merit.
`p`

`p.
Subjective assessments are intrinsic to most linguists' argumentation %-- warranting
claims not with empirical data or logico-mathematical proof but by appealing to
speakers' intuitions, so that reading linguistic texts is also collaborating
on an ongoing research project (partly because language evolves, so
word-meanings change, and formations which are ungrammatical for one generation
may be experienced differently by others).  Nevertheless, linguistics, like
economics, seems broadly accepted as a human `i.science`/, not just an
interpretive discipline.
The claim that an economist's equation or a linguist's meta-grammar
are accurate explanations, useful explanatory frameworks, seems generally
evaluated in terms of whether their framework captures emergent higher-order
structure, and offers an explanatory potential that does not merely reiterate lower-scale
paradigms.  A theory expressed in the language of linguistics (not, say,
neural networks), if it meets general criteria of testability and refutability
(not necessarily empiricist/quantitative),
arguably carries even more weight than lower-level neurophysical
explanation %-- precisely because the higher-scale `q.theory language` carries the burden of
explaining emergent properties, which as `i.emergent` bear some
descriptive/behavioral (if not causal) autonomy.  Likewise, a subjectively plausible
and theoretically motivated equation which fits economic data
probably carries more weight than a mere statistical analysis.  An explanatory focus
on the higher-scale in terms of its own distinct (emergent) structures and theorized
entities (like words and morphemes, in the case of linguistics, or markets and commodities,
in the case of economics), reflects the linguist's or economist's charge to connect
human phenomena with mental (and therefore, ultimately physical) law.  Nonetheless,
even with liberal use of subjective judgments, economics and linguistics (and some
other human sciences as well, potentially) are attached to the overall sphere of
natural science, by virtue of causal links in principle even if not in practice.
Scientific rigor in this humanistic setting is neither reducible to the techniques
of natural science, nor dualistically separate from them.  Natural
science and humanities are certainly not mutually irrelevant, but nor is
the proper vehicle for scientific literacy to find a forum in the humanities
merely to emulate numeric methods, as with statistics in sociology, or
a retreat to narrow and behavioristic reductionism, in
place of localized interpretation and situational particularism.
`p`

`p.
Subjective impressions (conscious experiences, emotions, intuitions, qualia, qualitative universals and
particulars %-- the qualitative characteristic in itself, and the hyletic-spatial trace,
the site in experiential space as the quale becomes a moment of consciousness) %-- these are not scientifically
tractable and do not have obvious physical location or measurability, which makes them controversial as
objects of scientific method.  Yet, even so, we do have conscious experiences, we
do subconsciously (and when needed consciously, or with deliberate conscious attention)
make judgments about classifications, or how parts aggregate into wholes, or are individuated
apart from a larger whole in context; we can reflect on patterns in these judgments,
not `i.introspectively` examining thoughts as they occur, but marshalling an overall
familiarity with mental processes.  Consciousness is not only a kind of mentality,
shared by humans and some animals; it is also a metacognitive tool, something we
deploy to focus attention on a certain object or topic.  We `q.practice` how to `i.be`
conscious, how best to distribute attention, in each setting
(like an athlete maintaining a meditative state of ambient awareness,
poised to latch conscious attention onto playing technique which is optimally instinctive,
but `q.feels` different when degraded by fatigue or distraction).
Our faculty for these modulations, switching among sub- and passive consciousness,
attentive consciousness, `q.ambient` awareness, and back again,
reveals that consciousness is not only an aspect of mind
but a tool; it has a meta-cognitive and epistemic dimension,
an awareness of what is known or not-yet-known and a technique of directing attention to the
latter.
`p`

`p.
A case-study: in a motel I unexpectedly find a newspaper outside the
door.  Next morning I look outside curious whether a paper is there; after several days
I come to expect the paper.  So I open the door not preoccupied with confirming this, but
with (maybe rather distractedly) fetching it.  Initially I do not expect the paper, but, generally poised
to notice both expected and unexpected circumstances, I make a mental adjustment and
interpret the situation quickly; by the third day the paper has become expected,
like other things I anticipate finding in a motel hallway, and the thrust of my attention,
during the brief episode of my picking it up, is kinaesthetic and motor-intentional
more than visual and inquisitive.
Only on the second morning is the question of a paper's presence intended
in an epistemic mode; but, while it is so thematized, I direct attention
to optimize my ability to resolve the question.  How we engage attention is a
deliberate choice, reflecting and responding to our metacognitive attitudes,
what we think we know and do not know.
`p`

`p.
Because consciousness is in some ways a mental tool, we have an intimate familiarity with it, a
familiarity which extends beyond our own minds: we can make reasonable guesses about what
others do or do not know and perceive.  Our ability to anticipate others' epistemic states
is an intrinsic feature of social interaction, of intersubjectivity;
we therefore understand consciousness not only via our
own use and possession/experience of it, but as a general feature of the human mind.
We can accordingly make structured claims about conscious processes, not
in the sense of introspective reports but of retrospective suggestions %-- by analogy, a
pianist on reflection may have alot to say about playing technique, but she does not
acquire this wisdom from introspective study of her own playing while it happens;
rather with accrued wisdom and reflection.  In terms of phenomenological method, our study of thought
and consciousness is analogous: it is reflective examination of what it means to be
consciously intelligent beings, not introspective psychology, or meditative meta-experience.
`p`

`p.
The methodological implications of this retrospection
(as opposed to `i.intro`/spection), how phenomenological writing seeks
reflective consensus on claims about consciousness %--
this fashion of constructing a research community, a discursive-methodological
field, does not conform to empirical scientific method, but is arguably a quite
valid and defensible means of meeting the criteriological goals %-- the discourse
ethics, the democratization of scientific participation %-- which
physical science achieves via empiricist Ontology.
For all its limitations, Positivism
has the one virtue of disputational inclusiveness, demanding potential
observability (not some special revelation or insight)
for theoretic ur-entities.  The civic norms of phenomenology are more complex, because both
`q.transcendental` analysis of consciousness %-- as a kind of philosophical ground zero, a neo-Cartesian
fortress against skepticism and empiricism %-- and also a more pluralistic, enculturated,
embodied, social phenomenology, are well-represented (and interpenetrate in complex ways)
in the continuing post-Husserl tradition.  That being said, even in its most neo-Idealist, reifying consciousness
as a primordial frame on any cognitive-scientific reasoning, as human sciences' condition of
possibility, phenomenology cannot help but textually acknowledge pluralism, and philosophical
collaboration %-- precisely because its claims are not descriptive of empirically locatable/observable objects.
`p`

`p.
Interestingly, the phenomenological tradition reveals substantial interest in both
the socio-political and the formal-mathematical: this is not so noteworthy
in itself, because Analytic philosophy also connects (say) language with
(say) logic, but phenomenology is distinct in that
it joins the humanistic and the formal/mathematical without the same
tendency to hone in on a overlapping, logico-semantic core.  In writings where
Analytic philosophers appear to address both social and mathematical concerns, usually their
underlying motivation, or so it seems to me, is to find some logical
underpinnings to linguistic or cognitive structure (say, `i.implicatures`/) %-- logic, subject
to formal treatment, also manifesting itself in the organization of thoughts and
expressions.  Amongst phenomenologists, however, for example Husserl,
Merleau-Ponty (in his science-oriented writings; `cite<DavidMorris>;), and Anglo-American
writers in the `q.Naturalizing Phenomenology` tradition,
there is evident interest in mathematics `i.apart from` logic: topology,
differential geometry, mereotopology, multi-granularity.`footnote.
Not that logic is wholly unrelated to these subjects: consider
topological and type/Category-theoretic embeddings of logical systems
within certain categories, or technical domains, like toposes, sheaves, granules;
but logic in this sense, mathematically founded within spaces otherwise discussed
at least as metaphoric guides within phenomenology, does not
appear to be the dominant understanding of logic in the Analytic
philosophical tradition.  To be fair, style may dictate that
argumentation should be trimmed to its essential elements, and
mathematical deductions are rarely if ever essential for
defending phenomenological claims.  In Jean Petitot, for example,
mathematics is sometimes intrinsic to empirical backing for
phenomenological ideas, but other times (say, sheaf mereology),
the formal theories, while useful analogies, do not clearly pair up with
logico-deductive justifications.  But, I would reply, there
is so much unexplained about consciousness, and cognition
as it occurs in conscious minds --- the controversial `q.Explanatory Gap`
between mind and matter --- that much of the important
argumentation does not yet have deductive signposts; we need an
effective methodology which is not so linear.
As we approach beyond a simplifying, logico-functionalist vantage,
which we eventually must transcend, both functionalization and empiricism
fall by the wayside as reasonable methods for `q.Naturalizing` consciousness.
We have to accept when the formal/mathematical stands as more intuitive
than rhetorical, on pain of `q.Naturalization` being quarantined
from a humanistic core entirely.
`footnote`
Phenomenology therefore uncovers
an arguably deeper and truer bridge between human and `q.eidetic` sciences,
in Petitot's phrase, one which is not pre-loaded with logico-reductive presuppositions.
If this is accurate, phenomenology can provide a deeper methodology
for the humanities in their interactions with natural science.
Even insofar as we stay committed to the idea
that social/cultural/mental phenomena emerge from (neuro-)physical ones, we
need to curate methods for these `q.emergent` sciences which have the requisite
theoretical autonomy to actually extend the explanatory reach of the natural
sciences on which they causally rest.  Cognitive Linguistics, I would argue,
is a good example of this notion of autonomy, and its methodology, I would
also argue, bears an important resemblance to phenomenological research.
`p`

`p.
Another brief case-study (revisiting footnote `ref<footnoteVision>;):
our environing world mostly discloses itself through objects' visible exterior:
as much as we have on occasion a palpable sense of volume as well (as when looking through a fog)
%-- and as much as what we see is inextricable from our embodied interactions with objects,
adding tactile and kinaesthetic dimensions, a canonical sense of perception
is still the vision of distant objects, usually through their
surface geometry.  A canonical example of perceptual
cognition is therefore reconstructing geometry from visual appearances,
especially color gradations %-- mathematically, converting `q.color` vector
fields to curvature vector fields (it's worth noting that color is an
almost primordial example of a Conceptual Space Theory as developed
by `Gardenfors; and others `cite<Strle>;).  This kind of transformation,
described (say) via differential geometry, is `i.qua` theoretical device
an example of semiotic morphism, a mapping between
representation disciplines `cite<GoguenSemioticMorphism>;, `cite<GoguenWhatIs>;.
The point is not, however, that there are precise correlates in the brain which
`q.implement` this procedure; that the semiotic morphism takes
a domain and codomain that quantify over empirically locatable,
neurophysical entities.  We can study how software reconstructs
geometry from color data as an approximation to a `i.process`/,
a model-building whose semiotics of approximation is coarse-grained and
holisitc.`footnote.
The experiential verisimilitude of computer graphics is a
phenomenological data point, but so is their obvious unreality %--
the mathematics reveals something about, but is not an all-encompassing
model for, shape and color `i.qua` material phenomenon, still less
the neuroscience of color experience.  Morphism between structures
may model `i.processes` more correctly than the structures themselves approximate their substrata
%-- but this is no longer a semiotics of causal/physical reductionism,
a use of mathematics (like differential geometry) to iconify empirical givens, the way
that (say) the Navier-Stokes equations are understood to refer explicitly to (even while idealizing
and abstracting from) fluid-mechanical dynamics.
Our theory-semiotics has to locate the site of designation
at a more oblique scale, a different Ontological register, of processes and
transformations %-- seeing in phenomena the image of a theoretical
model because of its global structure, as a sign in its own right,
rather than a collage of symbols and numbers to which are
reduced spatializations and trajectories of causation and physical influence.
`footnote`  Formal
devices like vectors or vector fields need not mold symbolic systems
by mapping individual symbols to spacetime objects, or processes, but rather
afford representation-mappings that capture cognition indirectly and patternwise.
`p`

`p.
I make this point using visual consciousness as an example, but it applies
also to cognitive grammar, where the color -to- curvature-vector
morphism has an analogue in the mapping of word-sequences to tree- or graph-algebras.
I do not intend to claim that there are specific, individuated neurophysical
analogues to theoretical posits in the symbolic regime I sketched earlier,
in terms of `POS; and lexical annotations, inter-word and inter-phrase connections,
applicative structures, and the rest.  There are not, necessarily, for example,
little brain regions whose role is to represent different types of
phrase structures (e.g., different flavors of pluralization).
Our explanatory ambitions, instead, should be cognitive-linguistic models of a
global process-structure, agnostic about one-to-one correspondence between the posits of the theory and the
empirical stuff whose behaviors it wants to explain.  Cognitive triggers bridge formal/empirical sciences with
the phenomenological/humanistic: their causal engenderings are physical and structural phenomena, but their
manifestation in the world is not fully tractable without an interpersonal deliberation accounting for both the
privateness of consciousness and the sociality of mind, and, so, something akin to phenomenology.
`p`

`p.
It may appear that I am describing a weak-functional theory (or metatheory)
which uses functional description in lieu of precise micro-physical
explanation %-- in other words, that in lieu of explaining precisely how
the brain achieves vision or language, we describe functional capabilities
that are prerequisite for these competences, and refactor the goal
of scientific explanation as to describe the system of intermediate functionality
as correctly as possible, rather than describe how this functionality
is physically realized.  In a strong form, this re-orientation yields
functionalism in theories/philosophies of Mind, that try to refrain from
Ontological commitments to mental states or properties `i.apart from` descriptions of
their functional roles.  In other words, according to the
parameters of the field of study and its institutions, even if not deep
metaphysical beliefs, mental states are reducible to functional states, and cognitive
systems are scientifically equivalent if they reveal similar functional organization, whether
they belong to human or animal minds or computers or extra-terrestrials.  A
more modest functionalism would reject the implied reductionistic
(maybe eliminative) Ontological
stance, and maintain that mental things are not wholly, metaphysically subsumed
by their functional organization, while still practicing a kind of
theory whereby this functional organization is the proper object of
study; the specific aspect of the mental realm
which is scientifically tractable.
`p`

`p.
I do not believe I am making even such weak-functionalist claims:
either branch of functionalism can misattribute the methodological
association between theoretical structures and explanatory goals.
We may be led toward the stronger or weaker functionalist viewpoints
if we understand that a cognitive theory should task itself with making
symbolic icons for scientifically grounded referents, grounded in an abstract
space of functional organization if not in empirical space-time.
Of course, most scientific explanation does construct a specialized,
technical semiotics whose signs refer into either formal spaces or
accounts of empirical space-bound things, however abstracted or idealized.
But, conversely, insofar as I propose to focus on functional structures, and particularly
cross-representation-framework transformations, my intent is to
`q.functionalize` the discursive norms of the theory, not the
phenomena it investigates.  In order to negotiate between the competing
demands of scientific rigor and formalization %-- on the one hand %--
with the immediacy and etheriality and subjectivity of consciousness, on the other,
we need to `q.attach` theoretical structures to mental phenomena without
getting bogged down in questions of the scientific or Ontological
status of mental things, how they are `q.scientific` individually and collectively
(collectively as in the Ontology of `q.Mind` overall).
`p`

`p.
This suggests adopting functional attitudes not
in the theory but the metatheory: to use functionalism as an organizing
principle on the theoretical `i.discourse`/, on the attitudes of the
scientists and scholars who want to straddle the divide between natural
and mathematical sciences and humanism and consciousness.  The
`q.semiotic morphism` of color-to-curvature vector fields, or word-sequences
to typed semantic graphs, are recommendations for guidelines on how
researchers should write and communicate about cognitive processes in their
global structure.  I have tried to outline a metadiscourse more than
a metalanguage %-- not a template for building theory-languages whose
signs refer into a realm of posited empirical or abstract entities, but a
template for using certain formal-mathematical constructions (in
domains like typed lambda calculus, type theory, or differential geometry) as a
textual prelude, a way to position the norms of writing to be receptive
to both scientific-mathematical and phenomenological concerns.  If
semiotic morphisms like color-to-curvature or word-sequence-to-semantic-graph
have explanatory merit as ways to picture cognitive processes, this
merit is intended to be judged according to how it affects
discursive norms on this scientific borderlands between mathematics
and humanities, rather than how it reduces empirical phenomena
to mathematizable abstractions.  If there is `i.something` in cognition
analogous to these morphisms, even if `q.analogous` means merely that
holding the morphisms as formally defined in our minds while
thinking about cognition can show us philosophical ways forward,
then we should be interested in refining these
formalizations as part of the overall Cognitive-Phenomenological project.
`p`

`decoline;

`p.
The Cognitive-phenomenological project is very different, I believe,
than the AI or Atificial General Intelligence
projects.  Nevertheless, as I noted to conclude
Section 5, AI %-- for all its reductive ideology %--
does show the benefits of an intellectual framework
where researchers can experiment, try things out, and
write code.  We should not underestimate the power
of technology and experimentation to ground and engage
the scholarly process: it allows the scholar to
program her own research environment, autonomous
as necessary from academic and institutional paradigms
%-- which, notwithstanding a general acaemic
commitment to innovation, can get
mired in inertia: particularly when it
comes to interdisciplinary methodology
and particularly when it comes
to reengineering the publishing
process and the dissemination of scholarship.
There is a lot of technical and technological
potential which in the acaemic and publishing
communities is not being realized.
`p`

`p.
This is not just a procedural claim
tangential to actual scholarly argumentation:
we need new generations of publishing
tools to properly syntheize computational
technology with nonreductive,
humanities-based philosophies of mind
and consciousness.  We need to properly
implement the technological tools
that empowe individual scholars,
without buying uncritically
into academic and corporate appropriations
of technology for regressive ends.
`p`

`p.
In this sense we should look at formalizing but 
not `i.reductionistic` projects 
as case-studies in software or investigative tools whose practical
dimension spurs hands-on experimentation and decentralized,
extra-institutional open-source collaboration, but whose
theoretical commitments gravitate to
cognitive linguistics and phenomenology
%-- while bypassing an AI paradigm
that underestimates the cognitive
importance but complexity of social-situational
awareness and of sensate consciousness.
AI is not a canonical arbiter of software
practicality (our contemporary
instinct toward measuring all software
around AI-driven analytics and `q.Big Data`
reflects a clever marketing
campaign by companies with financial incentives to
prioritize AI research over other disciplines).
Nor is AI a value-neutral or politically progressive
vision of what human mind and society are like.
`p`

`p.
Perhaps this is part of what it means to be a phenomenologist
in the 21st century: not to
reject technology or computational models or to believe
in a mode of phenomenological research carried by
pure thought, but to embrace %-- as part of
the research infrastructure, of our own
respective academic identities %-- practical software that
suggests interesting cognitive-humanistic paradigms without
endorsing reductive AI hypotheses.  Insofar as
scholarship is a social phenomenon, the metaphilosophy
of `q.pure thought` is an illusion anyhow: theory
is inevitably mediated by the disciplinary
expectations of its audience.  Given this reality,
software offers a renewed agency and autonomy to
the researcher: computer code does not
intrinsically know from disciplinary norms, and
the code-writer is programming a medium
where disciplinary boundaries can fade out %--
if the program compiles.  The programmer does not
`i.argue` for interdisciplinarity; she
`i.implements` it.
`p`

`p.
Technology, in conclusion, can liberate scholarship
from disciplinary inertia in the same gesture as
open-source software liberates technology itself
from commercial oligarchizing.
Good open-source software programs monetary
inequalities out of existence; as humanities
scholars we have an analogous duty to
program disparaties in intellectual capital
and influence out of existence.  Open-source software
is the fiat currency of the digital commons;
by analogy, phenomenology is
the liberation theology of
the intellectual commons.  We don't
argue for a just and existential
foundation of the humanities
and the natural/social science interface: we implement it.
`p`

`p.
Sophisticated but philosophically and
morally responsible cognitive-computational
paradigms are probably more likely to
arise from adding formal methodology and
open-sourc experimentalism to a
fundamentally humanities foundation, rather
than bringing sensitivity to human
nuance to a natural-science
academic tradition.  The reasons for
this are institutional as well as
intellectual: insofar as formal-computational
models are still rather unfamiliar in
humanities contexts, practitioners in a
hybrid cognitive-computational-humanities
orientation can have a level of autonomy
that helps us distinguish sophisticated computational
models from simplistic philosophical
(and commercial) paradigms.
And the affordances of open-source code
and digital publishing supports a
robust but low-cost technological environment,
tangential to academic laboratories and
hierarchies.
`p`

`p.
Perhaps this open-source
ecosystem is a worthy 21st-century field
wherein to continue 20th-century phenomenology.  Let's
not forget that phenomenology began as a philosophy
of mathematics but evolved into a
moral, political, and Existential system.
Honoring the subtelty of human consciousness is a way
to respect the technical priorities of
phenomenological philosophy but also
the political activism that %-- certainly
often rendered into praxis by the
intersectionality of lived experience with
race, class, and gender %-- follows
from phenomenological ethics.
`p`

`p.
Kant's critical philosophy did not only inspire
generations of abstract Idealism; it spurred the
cosmopolitan ideal of a Community of Nations
and the municipalist axiology of,
in particular, Kant's 19th century French translator,
Jules Barni.  Our communal existence
is not intrinsically, cognitively, tribal
or chauvinistic: the basic adaptation
of human minds to ecologies transcends race, class,
and culture.  Cultural differences are real, but
external: enculturation is minds being
shaped by the natural and civil infrastructure
around us.  While preserving nation and comunity
as a practical medium, Kantianism unmasks
nationalism as a metaphysical gambit.  This is
perhaps how, for Barni, Critical Philosophy
flows organically into municipalist activism:
to understand the mind we have to
embed ourselves into the cognitive patterning
of mind, which means the environs where
cognition is honed, which means our urban
and neighborhood ecologies.  The
architecture of cognition lies not
only in the cultures we receive via transmission
%-- religion, education, inter-generational
ideologies %-- but in the grid of the streets
outside our front door.
`p`

`p.
The axis from Kant to Barni has 21st century analogs:
Husserl as our Kant, and progressive ethical frameworks
like Murray Bookshin's libertarian municipalism
taking the mantle from Barni's post-1848
variety.  But one key difference is that communities
are now partly (though of course not
entirely) digital, virtual, and technological.
So, I believe, part of being a phenomenologist in the 21st
century is to %-- as much as we can, and virtually if need be
%-- implement a municipalism
in our time that metastatizes Husserl in a
recapitulation of how, for example, Barni
metastatized Kant.  This is not just
an abstract exercise, because intellectuals
are performing their commitment to humanities
scholarship, to the progressive and
cosmopolitan spirit of humanities discourse, in
environments far more challenging than
we associated with Western academia %-- Budapest;
Rojava.  This is part of what I had in mind
referring to `q.phenomenological ethics`/.

Wes Enzinna, a New York Times reporter who taught a journalism
class at the Mesopotamian Social Sciences Academy in Qamishli,
told a story (in the Times Sunday Magazine, November 29 2015)
about his reconciliation with students after a
brief culture-shock-like falling out:

`quote,
`q.We reject the master-and-slave relationship as a model
for the teacher-and-student relationship,` Ali said.
`q.But we've decided that you're welcome to continue teaching us.`
Ramah, the atheist, stood up and said,
`q.I'm so happy you're here.`
They all approached my desk and turned in their assignments.
`quote`

Sherhad Naaima, another Kurdish activist a few months earlier,
put it this way (in an interview with Eleanor Finley from
the Institute for Social Ecology in Vermont):

`quote,
History is a river, it cannot be cut. We have no West or East, but rather one
history which is moving and retaining all human culture ...
[T]he Left needs to dive deeper into hidden history and revive
their own traditions of freedom and the idea of a utopia of freedom.
They then must build a holistic theory provided by the unity of
natural sciences and social sciences.
That new theory can be called `q.the epistemology of freedom`/.
`quote`

These testimonies are what `q.to the things themselves` means today.
