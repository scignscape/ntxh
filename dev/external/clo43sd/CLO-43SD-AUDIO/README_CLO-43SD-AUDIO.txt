Description
-----------

The CLO-43SD-AUDIO dataset contains audio clips of 5428 flight calls 
from 43 different species of North American wood-warblers (in the family 
Parulidae). The dataset can be used, amongst other things, for the research, 
development and testing of bioacoustic classification models, including the 
reproduction of the results reported in:

[1] J. Salamon, J. P. Bello, A. Farnsworth, M. Robbins, S. Keen, H. Klinck and 
    S. Kelling, “Towards the Automatic Classification of Avian Flight Calls for 
    Bioacoustic Monitoring”, submitted.


Data Files
----------

All 5428 flight call audio clips in this dataset are provided in WAV format
with 16 bit precision, a sample rate of 22050 Hz, and a single channel (mono).

The species of each call is indicated by the 4 letter code at the beginning of 
the filename (e.g. AMRE = American Redstart). A table mapping each 4 letter 
code to the full species name is provided as metadata (see Metadata Files).


Metadata Files
--------------

A single metadata file is provided in CSV format: CLO-43SD-AUDIO.csv
The file contains 3 columns:
    - Name: The full name of the species
    - Abbreviation: the 4 letter abbreviation code for the species
    - Instances: the number of times this species occurs in the dataset
