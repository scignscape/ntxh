%test: This test should test the "copy to clipboard"
  functionality which is in effect when there is a 
  currently active sample; ordinarily this feature 
  would be available via a context menu for right-click 
  actions near the sample display, and should result 
  in the sample text being copied to the system clipboard.
  Successful copying can be tested by pasting the 
  clipboard contents to the scratch area on the test dialog.
