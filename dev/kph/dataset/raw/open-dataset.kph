%test: This test should replicate the response of the 
   dataset application when a user chooses to open a 
   new dataset (via the "open" button at the top-left 
   of the application window/dialog).  The application 
   should open a file-open dialog and, if the user  
   chooses a valid data set, should switch to 
   viewing that data-set's samples in lieu of the current data.
