The phrase `i.latest dogs` carries implications in its own 
right; we assume the neighbor had owned other dogs before.  
Of course `q.latest` implies some temporal order, but the 
understood time-scale depends on context.  
If we hear talk about a `i.vet`/'s two latest dogs, we would presumably 
interpret this in terms of patients the vet has seen over the course of 
a day: 

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:vet -> We have to wait until after the vet's two latest dogs. ->  ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:organization -> I'm concerned for the rescue organization's
two latest dogs. -> sem ;;
`sentenceList`
 
Understanding the relevant time-frame depends on understanding the relation
between the dogs and the possessive antecedent.  In (`ref<itm:latest>;)
the neighbor (in a typical case) actually owns the dogs, so the 
situational context grounding the modifier `i.latest` would be understood 
against the normal time-scale for dog ownership (at least several years).  
In (`ref<itm:vet>;), the vet only `q.possesses` the dogs in the sense 
of endeavoring to examine them, a process of minutes or hours.  
In (`ref<itm:organization>;), the implication of the `i.organization's` 
possessive `visavis; rescued dogs is that the group endeavors 
to rehabilitate and find permanent homes for the rescuees.  So in each
case `i.latest` implies a succession of dogs, leading over time to 
two most recent ones, but the implied time-frame for our conceptualizing 
this sequence can be minutes-to-hours, or days-to-months, or years.
