According to Miriam Fried and Jan-Ola |"O|stman,

`quote,
The primary motivation for Construction Grammar is the insight that
the juxtaposition of two or more forms seldom results in a simple
concatenation of the meanings those forms might have in isolation.
Consequently, Construction Grammar sees linguistic units as particular
associations between form and meaning that must be represented as such,
rather than leaving such associations to the operation of a set of rules for how
to combine individual forms. |+| `cite<[page 3]FriedOstman>;

I would qualify this paradigm merely by suggesting that we should 
not discount the compositionality of language solely on the 
basis of linguistic form not seeming to reciprocate 
`i.logical` compositions, because ---  as I have stressed numerous times here --- 
there are other ways for aggregate meaning to be built from component 
parts than via mimicking predicate composition.
