The problem with this analysis is that sometimes
directive and `q.inquisitive` dimensions can
overlap: |+|

`sentenceList,
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:almond -> Do you have almond milk? -> pra ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> --- -> Can you get MsNBC on your TV? -> pra ;;
`sentenceItem; `swl -> itm:needcorkscrew -> This isn't a screw-cap bottle: I need a corkscrew. -> pra ;;
`sentenceList`

 |.|

These `i.can` be read as bare directives, and would
be interpreted as such if the hearer believed the
speaker already knew that yes, he has almond milk, and yes,
he gets MsNBC.  In (`ref<itm:needcorkscrew>;), if both parties
know there's one corkscrew in the house,
the statement implies a directive to fetch `i.that` corkscrew.
But, equally, (`ref<itm:almond>;)-(`ref<itm:needcorkscrew>;) can `i.also` be read as bare
questions with no implicature: say, as fans of
almond milk and MsNBC endorsing those selections,
or pointing out that opening the bottle
will need `i.some` corkscrew.
And, meanwhile, (`ref<itm:almond>;)-(`ref<itm:needcorkscrew>;)
can `i.also` be read as a mixture of the
two, as if people expressed themselves like this`\(:) |=|
