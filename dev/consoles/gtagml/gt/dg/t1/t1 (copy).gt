`p.
The idea that inter-word pairs are a foundational linguistic 
unit %-- from which larger aggregates can be built up recursively 
%-- is an central tenet of Dependency Grammar.  Here I will 
generalize this perspective outside (but not excluding) 
grammar, to overall semantic, pragmatic, and even 
extralinguistic relations indicated via interword relations.
