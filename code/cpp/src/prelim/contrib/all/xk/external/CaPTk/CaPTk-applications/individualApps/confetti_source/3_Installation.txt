\page Installation Installation Guidelines

# Binary Distributions

Confetti is distributed in the form of pre-compiled (binary) as part of CaPTK Windows and Linux installers; those are recommended installations.

For Windows, the package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation.

We are actively working on producing builds for different Linux distributions and macOS machines.

# Building Confetti from Source Code

Source code for the Confetti comandline interface and commandline interface and shared library used for python based graphical interface is distributed for sites that wish to examine the code, collaborate with CBICA in future development, and for compatibility.
See <a href="Compilation.html">Compilation</a> for build instructions.

The GUI version is built using python using the C++ core as shared library (for performance).
On windows, the GUI is distributed as standalone package. On Linux, the python source file provided as is (see sub directory pyGUI). to be able to use python GUI, following required packages must be installed in the default python distribution. 
	  "numpy >= 1.11.1",  "PyQt4 == 4.11.4",	  "VTK == 6.3.0"
A setup.py provided to make the installation easier.
