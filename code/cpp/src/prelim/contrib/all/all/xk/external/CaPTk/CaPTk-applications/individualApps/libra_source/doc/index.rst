Overview
========

The **Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment** (LIBRA), a software package developed by the `Computational Breast Imaging Group (CBIG)
<http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/radiology/research/labs/cbig/>`_ 
at the University of Pennsylvania, is a fully-automatic breast density estimation software solution based on a published algorithm that works on either raw (i.e., "FOR PROCESSING") or vendor post-processed (i.e., "FOR PRESENTATION") digital mammography images from two vendors: GE Healthcare and Hologic. Based on an algorithm published in `Medical Physics
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22894417>`_, 
LIBRA has been applied to over 30,000 screening exams and is being increasingly utilized in larger studies.

LIBRA has two modes of operations: 

1. An easy-to-use interactive mode with Graphical-User-Interface where the user is prompted to select either a single DICOM image or a folder of DICOM images, an output folder for the results, and whether they wish to save intermediate files. 

2. A command-line interface amenable to batch processing and scripting, where the user can explicitly define the input and output paths.
