\mainpage Overview

Confetti is a method for automated extraction of white matter tracts of interest in a consistent and comparable manner over a large group of subjects without drawing the inclusion and exclusion regions of interest (ROI), facilitating an easy correspondence between different subjects, as well as providing a representation that is robust to edema, mass effect, and tract infiltration [1-3].

Input Requirements:
Parcellation of the brain into 87 Desikan/Freesurfer gray matter (GM) regions [4]. 
87 Track density images: For each region (among 87 GM regions), voxel-wise map of number of fibers connecting to the region. 
Streamlines (fibers) to be clustered: Either in Trackvis (.trk) or Camino (.Bfloat) format.



Confetti is principally developed and distributed by the <a

Analytics</a> at the University of Pennsylvania.
