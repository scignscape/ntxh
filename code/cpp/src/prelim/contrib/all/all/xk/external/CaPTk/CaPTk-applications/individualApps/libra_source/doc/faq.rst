FAQ
===

What is the expected input data format?
    `DICOM <http://dicom.nema.org/standard.html>`_ files, which do not necessary have extension, if any, .dcm is the most common one.


What are the DICOM requirements for analyzing mammograms using LIBRA?
    LIBRA requires the following imaging physics to accurately estimate the density:
    
    - ViewPosition (0018,5101)
    - XrayTubeCurrent (0018,1151) (if missing, LIBRA derives it from ExposureInuAs(0018,1153) and ExposureTime (0018,1150))
    - ImagerPixelSpacing (0018,1164)
    - BodyPartThickness (0018,11a0)
    - CompressionForce (0018,11a2)
    - Exposure (0018,1152)
    - KVP (0018,0060)
    
    LIBRA also relies on the following fields to choose the best model but would use a default model if missing
    
    - PresentationIntentType (0008,0068)
    - Manufacturer (0008,0070)


What can I do if the requirements are not fully met?
    You may collect the imaging physics and fill in the fields using `MATLAB <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/27241#answer_35465>`_, `pydicom in PYTHON <http://pydicom.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pydicom_user_guide.html>`_ or `dcmtk <http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/dcmodify.html>`_.
    

Is there a quick way to QC (quality control) large amount of processed data?
    We usually look at the left-right reading agreement, and raw-processed agreement to find out if there is any outlier. We sometimes see arond 0.1% to 1% of failure rates from our experience of processing more than 70,000 mammograms.
