\mainpage Overview

The WhiteStripe algorithm normalizes conventional magnetic resonance images [1] by detecting a latent subdistribution of normal tissue and linearly scaling the histogram of the images.

Input Requirements:
Inhomogeneity-corrected (N3 or N4) T1-weighted or T2-weighted images, ideally either skull-stripped or rigidly aligned to MNI space.



WhiteStripe is principally developed and distributed by the <a

Analytics</a> at the University of Pennsylvania.

This work was supported by NIH 1U24CA189523-01A1.
