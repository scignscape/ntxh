\page Installation Installation Guidelines

# Binary Distributions

WhiteStripe is distributed in the form of pre-compiled (binary) as part of CaPTK Windows and Linux installers; those are recommended installations.

For Windows, the package contains all required dependencies and does not need administrative privileges for installation.

We are actively working on producing builds for different Linux distributions and macOS machines.

# Building WhiteStripe from Source Code

Source code for the WhiteStripe graphical interface and commandline interface is distributed for sites that wish to examine the code, collaborate with CBICA in future development, and for compatibility. See <a href="Compilation.html">Compilation</a> for build instructions.
