INTRODUCTION
============

  LIBRA package provides both source code and pre-compiled executable. User may optionally compile an executable from the source. This document contains the build and installation instructions.



RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS
====================

  This software requires MATLAB R2012A* or above with the following toolboxes:

	- Curve Fitting Toolbox
	- Image Processing Toolbox
	- Signal Processing Toolbox
	- Statistics Toolbox
	- Symbolic Math Toolbox
	- MATLAB Compiler (optional for compiling binary).

  * CAUTION: There is a known bug and incompatibility to MATLAB R2013b (version: 8.2.0.705) on Windows that the dicomread.m function would randomly crash and terminate the matlab routine.


BUILDING THE SOFTWARE FROM SOURCES
==================================

  Build Dependencies
  ------------------

  MATLAB runtime and MATLAB Compiler are required to build and compile the executable.
	MATLAB R2012A or above	http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/
	MATLAB Compiler http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/

  Build Steps
  -----------

  See also INSTALL.txt.

  To compile the libra.m into a executable, change the directory to the Source/ directory within the main directory of the LIBRA package and run the following command in MATLAB environment:

    >> libra_compile('/path/to/output/executable/directory/') % In Unix
    or
    >> libra_compile('D:\path\to\output\executable\folder\') % In Windows

  A stand-alone executable libra (libra.exe in Windows) will be created in the specified directory. When libra_compile is called without an input argument, an "Executable" directory will be created in Source directory and "libra" executable will be generated there. This compilation requires MATLAB Compiler (mcc).

  After compilation, you can use the stand-alone executable without MATLAB environment and license.**

    $ libra PATH_INPUT_DIR PATH_OUTPUT_DIR

  ** Note: MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is required. Download a version of MCR that corresponds to the MCC used to compile the executable from http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/.
