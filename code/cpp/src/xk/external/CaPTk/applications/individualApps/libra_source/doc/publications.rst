When publishing results or data derived from this software, please include a bibliographical reference to the 2012 Keller et al. Medical Physics paper (PubMed ID: 22894417) describing the methodology as well as to the 2015 Keller et al. Breast Cancer Research paper (PubMed ID: 26303303) evaluating the association between LIBRA breast density and breast cancer risk in a case-control study. Other studies in which LIBRA has been used are also listed in references.
