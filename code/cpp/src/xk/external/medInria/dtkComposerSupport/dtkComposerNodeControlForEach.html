<h3>Perform foreach loop</h3>
<p>
The <b>Foreach</b> control node enable to iterate over all the items
of a given input container in order.
</p>
<p>
The node takes a container as input and executes the <em>body</em>
blocks until reaching the end of this container. For each iteration, users can retrieve the container itself, its size, the current item and the index of the current iteration.
</p>
<p>
During execution, the condition is firstly tested, then if it is valid
then the body composition is executed and eventually, the incrmental
process is performed.
</p>
<p>
The las value of the loop counter can be used further in the composition thanks to <em>i_end</em> port.
