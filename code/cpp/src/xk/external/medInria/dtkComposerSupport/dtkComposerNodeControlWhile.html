<h3>Perform while loop</h3>
<p>
The <b>While</b> control node allows you to execute a subpart of the
composition as long as a given condition is fullfilled. The condition
is tested before the first step is executed.
</p>
<p>
The node layout has two blocks:
<ul>
<li>The top one enables to define the loop criterion. The bottom block
is executed if only this criterion is valid.</li>
<li>The bottom block is actually the body of the while loop. It
contains the subcomposition that is executed when the top criterion is
valid.</li>
</ul>
</p>
