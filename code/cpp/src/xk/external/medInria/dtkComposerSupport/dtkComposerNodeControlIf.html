<h3>Select part of the composition</h3>
<p>
The <b>If</b> control node allows you to control if a part of the
composition is executed or not based on whether a given condition is
true or false.
</p>
<p>
The condition is set by linking "cond" port in the header of the node,
a boolean type being expected.
</p>
<p>
The part of the composition located in the "then" block is executed
when the condition is fullfilled. Otherwise, the part inside the
"else" block is performed.
