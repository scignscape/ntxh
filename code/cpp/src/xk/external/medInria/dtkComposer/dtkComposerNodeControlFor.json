<p>
The <b>For</b> control node is a convenient node that enable users to
mimic classical <em>for</em> instruction of C-language.
</p>
<p>
The node layout has threee blocks plus an input counter
value <em>i_begin</em> provided by a previous node of the
composition. This counter value can be incremented and used for test
stop criterion inside dedicated blocks, namely the
<em>conditional</em> block and the <em>increment</em>
block. The body of the loop is defined by the subcomposition standing
inside the <em>body</em> block.
</p>
<p>
During execution, the condition is firstly tested, then if it is valid
then the body composition is executed and eventually, the incrmental
process is performed.
</p>
<p>
The last value of the loop counter can be used further in the
composition thanks to <em>i_end</em> port.
