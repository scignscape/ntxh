<p>
The <b>Do While</b> control node allows you to execute a subpart of the
composition as long as a given condition is fullfilled. The condition
is tested after the first step is executed.
</p>
<p>
The node layout has two blocks:
<ul>
<li>The top one defines the body of the do while loop. It contains the
subcomposition that is executed at leas one time. The other execution
relies on the validity of the criterion that is defined by the botoom
block.
</li>
<li>The bottom block enables to define the loop criterion using a more
or less involved subcomposition. The loop is executed as long as this
criterion remains valid.
</li>
</ul>
