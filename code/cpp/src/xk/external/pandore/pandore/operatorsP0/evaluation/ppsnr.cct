 * PSNR is used to measure the difference between two
 * images. It is defined as:
 *
 *     PSNR = 10 * log10 ( (max*max) / MSE )
 *     MSE = sum ((ims1 - ims2)^2) / N
 *
 * where max is the parameter, and mse is the Mean Square Error
 * between the two images. 
 * If (max = -1) then use instead max(ims1)-min(ims1).
