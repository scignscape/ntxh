To compile a stand-alone executable for testing the Parser module, uncomment
the following line in the Parser.pro file:

CONFIG += debug_parser

The executable can be run from the command line (for Mac you need to type the
full path to the executable file, i.e.: Parser.app/Contents/MacOS/Parser).  The
program takes single argument, which should be a valid file name (for example
those in the test directory).  If the input file is water.out, then an output
file water.out.iqm is produced, which contains the IQmol compressed archive
data.  

If you run the program on one of the references, the checksums should be the
same (assuming you ran it in the test directory).  If they are not then re-run
the Parser with the -d switch on the problem file and archive.  This will give
a plain text output which can be diff'd.
