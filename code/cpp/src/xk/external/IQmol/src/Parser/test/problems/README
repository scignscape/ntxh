These files all cause problems in the Parser module, or are not handled correctly.

 - Alanine-path.pdb  
   File is read by the OpenBabel parser, but only a single geometry is
   displayed.  Need to probe Open Babel for multiple conformers.

  - AcetyleneOpt.gam
	Geometries are displayed and can be animated, but energies are not
    displayed.

  - AceticAcid_g98.log
    Geometries and Frequencies are loaded, but energies are not.

  - 3UT3.pdb
    Bus error encountered in OpenBabel::expandKekulize()

  - cube1.off
    Mesh file read.  File is parsed and displayed, but attempts to decimate the
    mesh or draw the vertex/face normals causes a crash in the OpenMesh library.

  - qmmm.*
    The QChemOutputParser complains about a mismatch in the number of atoms because 
    of the way the QM and MM atoms are merged in the coordinate list.  The FChk file
    is parsed okay.
