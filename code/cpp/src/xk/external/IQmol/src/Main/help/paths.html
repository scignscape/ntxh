   <center> <h1> Visualizing Pathways <br> </h1> </center><p></p>
 
   <p> IQmol can animate pathways, either from a geometry optimization or an
   intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculation.  Currently only output from
   the Q-Chem program is supported.

   <p> Visualization of the pathway is controlled via the Geometries
   configruator which can be opened by double clicking the Geometries layer in the
   Model View.  If the output has been read correctly a window similar to the
   following will appear:


   <p><center><img src="images/PathWindow.png" /></center></p>

   <p> Individual conformers can be selected and will be displayed in the
   Viewer.  Conformers can be selected by either directly clicking on them,
   pushing the  <img src="images/buttons/GoForward.png">  and 
   <img src="images/buttons/GoBack.png"> buttons, or by using the arrow
   keys on the keyboard.  The pathway can also be animated by clicking the
   <img src="images/buttons/Play.png">  button and the speed of the
   animation can be controlled via the slider.  

   <p> The Bounce button controls whether or not the direction of the animation
   is reversed at the end of the loop.  Click the Update Bonds button to 
   reperceive bonds for each geometry.
