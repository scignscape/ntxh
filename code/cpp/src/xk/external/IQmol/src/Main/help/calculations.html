   <center> <h1> Running Q-Chem <br> </h1> </center><p></p>

   <p> IQmol can be configured to run Q-Chem calculations either on your local
   machine or on a remote server.  In order to do this Q-Chem must be correctly
   installed on the computer that will be running the calculations.  A Server
   must also be configured as outlined below.

   <h3><a name="serverConfiguration"></a>Server Configuration</h3>

   <ol>
	  <li> Select the Calculation&rarr;Edit Servers menu option to add a new
		   Server.  A dialog will appear with a list of configured servers.
           Initially this list will be empty. <br>
	  <li> Click the Add New Server button with the '+' icon. This opens the
		   Server Dialog which allows the new server to be configured. The server is
           the machine which has your copy of Q-Chem installed.  <br>
   <p><center><img src="images/ServerDialog.png" /></center></p>

	  <li> Give the server a name (this is simply used to identify the current
		   server configuration and does not have to match the actual machine
		   name) and select if the machine is local (i.e. the same machine as
           IQmol is running on) or remote.  Presently, remote servers must be
           Unix-based (i.e. not a Windows server). <br>
	  <li> If there is PBS or SGE software running on the server, select the 
		   appropriate 'Type' option, otherwise the Basic option should
           suffice.  <br>
	  <li> If required, the server can be further configured using the
		   Configure button. Details on this can be found in the
            <a href="#serverOptions">Server Options</a> section below. <br>
	  <li> For non-PBS servers the number of concurrent Q-Chem jobs can be
		   limited using a simple inbuilt queuing system. The maximum number of
		   jobs is set by the Job Limit control. If the Job Limit is set to
		   zero the queue is disabled and any number of jobs can be run
		   concurrently.  Please note that this limit applies to the current
		   IQmol session and does not account for jobs submitted by other users
           or by other IQmol sessions.  <br>
	  <li> For remote servers the address of the machine and your user name are
		   also required. IQmol uses SSH to connect to remote machines and the
		   most convenient way to set this up is by using authorized keys (see
           <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/passwordlessssh"> 
		   http://www.debian.org/devel/passwordlessssh</a> for details on how
		   these can be set up). IQmol can then connect via the SSH Agent and
		   will not have to prompt you for your password. If you are not able
		   to use an SSH Agent, several other authentication methods are
           offered: 
           <ul>
			  <li> Public Key This requires you to enter your SSH passphrase
				   (if any) to unlock your private key file. The passphrase is
				   stored in memory, not disk, so you will need to re-enter
                   this each time IQmol is run.  <br>
			  <li> Password Vault This allows a single password (the vault key)
				   to be used to unlock the passwords for all the configured
				   servers. The server passwords are salted with 64 random bits
				   and encrypted using the AES algorithm before being stored on
				   disk. The vault key is not stored permanently and must be
                   re-entered each time IQmol is run. <br>
			  <li> Password Prompt This requires each server password to be
				   entered each time IQmol is run. Once the connection has been
				   established the memory used to hold the password is
				   overwritten to reduce the risk of recovery from a core dump.
				   Further configuration of SSH options should not be required
                   unless your public/private keys are stored in a non-standard
                   location.   <br>
           </ul>
      </ol>

   <p> For remote servers, it is recommended that you test the server connection
   before attempting to submit a job. Multiple servers can be configured if you
   have access to more than one machine with Q-Chem installed, or if you have
   different account configurations. In this case the default server is the first
   on the list and this can be changed by using the arrow buttons in the Server
   List dialog. 

   <p> Note that changes made to an existing server may not take effect until
   IQmol has been restarted.  If problems are encountered, particularly after
   upgrading, it is recommended that you delete the server and try configuring
   a new one.


   <h3><a name="serverOptions"></a>Server Options</h3>

   <p> If IQmol does not work with the default set up you can customize the
   behavior by clicking the Configure button in the Server Dialog.  This opens
   the Server Options window:
   
   <p><center><img src="images/ServerOptions.png" /></center></p>

   <p> The Command Settings define several commands which are used in the
   submission and control of Q-Chem processes.  Changes to these may be
   required if your system has non-standard paths to common utilities such as
   the ps command, or if the ouput from the command is non-standard.  

   <p> The Run File Template is the script that is used to run the Q-Chem job
   and can be configured to include, for example, the hostname or start time in
   the output file, or to copy scratch files to a permanent location.   If the
   necessary Q-Chem environment variables are not set in your .cshrc (or
   equivalent), they will need to be explicitly set here.

   <p> Valid macros that appear in the template will be substituted with
   specified values when submitting the job.  Macros are identified by the
   ${...} motif and are distinct from environment variables (which do not
   include the braces).  The following variables can be used:
   <ul>
	  <li> ${JOB_ID}: This is set to the PBS job number for PBS servers and the
           process ID otherwise.
	  <li> ${JOB_NAME}: This is the base name for the job and is what appears
		   as the molecule name in the Model View.  By default this is used to
		   name the input and output files and for this reason it should not
           include any spaces.
   </ul>

   <p> For PBS servers, the following additional variables are available.  The
	   user is prompted for values for these variables when submitting a job to
       a PBS server:
   <ul>
	  <li> ${QUEUE}: The name of the PBS queue to which the job is submitted.
	  <li> ${WALLTIME}: The wall time limit for job.
	  <li> ${MEMORY}: The virtual memeory limit for the job.
	  <li> ${SCRATCH}: The file space limit for the job.
	  <li> ${NCPUS}: The number of CPUs to use.  Note you will need a parallel
           version of Q-Chem for this option to have any effect.
   </ul>

   

   <h3><a name="submittingCalculations"></a>Submitting Calculations</h3>

   <p> Calculations can be set up via the Calculation&rarr;Q-Chem Setup menu option.
   A dialog appears with the current molecule inserted into the input.  Changes to the
   various options can be made using the appropriate controls before selecting the
   desired server and submitting the job.  You will be prompted for a name for the
   working directory and, if it is a PBS server, resource limits.

   <p> Please note that while Q-Chem is file-based, as of version 2.1 IQmol
   uses a directory to organize the various files from a calculation. 

   <h3><a name="processMonitor"></a>The Process Monitor</h3>

   <p> Once the job has been succesfully submitted, you can monitor its progress
   using the Process Monitor which can be opened via the Calculations&rarr;Job
   Monitor menu option.  

   <p><center><img src="images/ProcessMonitor.png"/></center></p>

   <p> The Process Monitor displays a list of submitted jobs and their current
   status which is updated every few seconds as determined by the Update
   Interval in the Server Options dialog.  Right-clicking on an item in the
   monitor brings up a context menu which allows you to perform certain tasks
   such as terminating the process or viewing the output from a finished
   calculation.
      
   <p> When a job complete successfully, the output is automatically loaded
   into IQmol.  The presence of new output is indicated by a 
   <img src="images/Favourites.png"> icon in the Model View.
