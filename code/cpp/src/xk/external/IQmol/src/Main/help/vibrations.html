   <center> <h1> Vibrational Frequencies <br> </h1> </center><p></p>
 

   <p> IQmol can be used to visualize vibrational frequncies by either
   animation or by displaying the displacement vectors associated with a normal
   mode.  In order to display these, IQmol needs the output from a frequency
   calculation.

   <p> Visualization of the vibrations is controlled via the Vibrational
   Frequencies window, which can be opened by double clicking the Frequencies
   layer in the Model View.  If the output has been read correctly a window
   similar to the following will appear:

   <p><center><img src="images/VibrationsWindow.png" /></center></p>

   <p> The displacement vectors for the selected mode are displayed by default.
   Modes can be selected by either directly clicking on them, pushing the  
   <img src="images/buttons/GoForward.png">  and
   <img src="images/buttons/GoBack.png"> buttons, or by using the arrow keys on
   the keyboard.  The amplitude slider can be used to scale the vectors to the
   desired size. 

   <p> A mode can also be animated by either selecting it and clicking the
   <img src="images/buttons/Play.png">  button, or by simply double clicking
   the mode on the list.  The amplitude and speed of the motion can be
   controlled via their respective sliders.

   <p><h3>Note</h3></p>

   <p>
   <ul>
      <li> Very small displacement vectors are not displayed for clarity.  To
           see these the amplitude slider should be increased to enlarge the
           scale of the vectors.
   </ul>
