   <p> Some of the animations in IQmol can be recorded to make movie files that
   can be displayed using video software.  On OS X IQmol can use the built-in
   system support for QuickTime to generate a .mov file.  For Linux and
   Windows IQmol will simply save the individual image files and these will
   need to be compiled into a movie file using third party software.

   The animations that can be recorded are:
   <ul>
      <li> Vibrational frequencies
      <li> Pathways (optmization and IRC)
      <li> Symmetrization of structures
      <li> Adding hydrogens
      <li> Translation to center
   </ul>

   <p> To record an animation, click the Record Animation Tool Bar button,
   <img width=28 src="images/buttons/Movie.png"> Tool Bar button.  You will be
   prompted for a either the name of the movie file (OS X) or the base name for
   the image files (Linux and Windows - individual image files will be numbered
   sequentially).  The Tool Bar button will begin to flash showing that the
   images are being recorded and you may notice a slow down in the animation
   speed as the files are written to disk.  All animations will continue to be
   recorded until the Record Animation Tool Bar button is pressed again to end
   the recording.  On OS X the image files will then be compiled into a .mov 
   file and you may notice a slight delay while this is happening, depending on
   the length of the movie.

   <p> When recording, only the auto-update frames are recorded.  If you
   manually rotate or otherwise manipulate the molecule while recording you may
   not get what you expected.  If no animation is active, then no frames are
   recorded even if the Tool Bar button is flashing.  So a pause between
   animating two frequencies, for example, will not give rise to a pause in the
   final movie.

   <p> For recordings of vibrational frequencies and pathways it is recommended
   that the Loop checkbox that appears in the configurators is unchecked to
   prevent multiple cycles from being recorded.
