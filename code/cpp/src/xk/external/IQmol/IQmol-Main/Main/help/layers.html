   <h3><a name="layers"></a>Introduction</h3>

   <p> IQmol uses the concept of Layers for overlays that are displayed on the
   molecule model and also for representing data associated with a molecule.
   Layers appear in the Model View section of the main window and form a tree
   structure.  A checkbox besides a layer item indicates that the user has
   control over the visibility of the layer.  Unchecking this causes the layer and
   all its children to become invisible.

   <p> Many layers can be configured by double clicking the layer item in the
   Model View.  If there are any options for the layer, a dialog will appear
   displaying them.  For example, double clicking on the molecule name causes
   the molecule configurator dialog to appear which contains options for changing
   the way the molecule appears (CPK, tubes etc.) and also allows model density
   surfaces to be added.

   <p> Note that each layer is configured separately, which gives maximum
   control over the appearance of elements that make up the system.


   <br>
   <h3><a name="global"></a>Global Layers</h3>

   <p> These layers are always present and can be accessed by opening the
   Global layer item at the top of the Model View.  They represent items
   that are not associated with a particular molecule.

   <p> <b>Background:</b> This layer allows the user to change the color of the
   Viewer background.  The checkbox can be used to disable the current color
   and turns the background white.  This is useful when taking snapshots that
   should have a white background.  The configurator allows the color to be
   changed.

   <p> <b>Axes:</b> This layer provides a visual aid to identify the cartesian
   axes in the Viewer.  The axes are colored red (<i>x</i>), green (<i>y</i>),
   blue (<i>z</i>).

   <p> <b>Mesh:</b> This layer provides a visual aid to identify the cartesian
   planes in the view.  A regular grid is drawn in either the <i>xy</i> (default), 
   <i>xz</i> or <i>yz</i> planes.  The density of the mesh and its type (either
   (cartesian or radial) can be configured.



   <br>
   <h3><a name="molecule"></a>Molecule Layers</h3>

   <p> IQmol supports the display of multiple molecules and each molecule is
   represented by its own layer in the Model View.  Data elements associated with
   the molecule are appended as children.  A non-empty molecule always has the 
   following layers:

   <ul>
	  <li> <b>Info:</b> The Info configurator provides a container for
		   information about the molecule such as the number of atoms,
           molecular mass and point group.  The dipole direction vector
           is appended as a child to the Info layer.<br>

      <li> <b>Atoms:</b> a list of the atoms in the system.  Atoms can be
           selected using the Model View.  Multiple atoms can be selected by
           holding down the <i>shift</i> key or the <i>ctrl</i> modifier
           (&#8984; key on Mac).<br>

      <li> <b>Bonds:</b> a list of the bonds in the system.  Like atoms, bonds
           can also be selected using the Model View.<br>
   </ul>


   <br>
   <h3><a name="other"></a>Other Layers</h3>

   <p> In addition to the above layers, there are several other layers that
   form part of the molecule data structure.  These layers only appear when
   certain actions are taken by the user, for example opening a file.

   <ul>
      <li> <b>Files:</b> A list of files associated with the molecule that
		   contain data that can be visualized using IQmol.  These include:
		   output files (.out), formatted checkpointg files (.fchk) and cube
		   files (.cube).  Double clicking a data file brings up a file viewer
           that allows the user to view and search the contents of the file. <br>

	  <li> <b>Surfaces:</b> There are two surfaces layers.  One appears when
           a formatted checkpoint file has been loaded into IQmol, the other
           appears when a surface (vdW, or pseudo density) is generated from
		   the molecule configurator.  In each case this layer contains a list
           of the various surfaces that have been generated for the molecule.  
		   See the <a href="surfaces.html">Plotting Surfaces</a> section on how
		   to generate different types of surfaces.  Configuring a surface
		   layer allows the user to customise the colors, surface property,
		   rendering and some of the OpenGL display vairables (e.g.
           transparency).<br>

	  <li> <b>Frequencies:</b> This layer appears when an output file containing
		   a frequency job is loaded.  See the 
           <a href="vibrations.html">Vibrational Frequecies</a> section for more
           details.<br>

	  <li> <b>Geometries:</b> This layer appears when an output file containing
           an optimization or intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) job is loaded.
		   See the <a href="paths.html">Visualizing Pathways</a> section for more
           details.<br>

	  <li> <b>Constraints:</b> A list of constraints that have been applied to
		   the molecule.  Constraints can be added by selecting the appropriate
           atoms and using the Build&rarr;Set Constraint menu option.  The type of
           constraint is determined by the number of selected atoms:
           <ol>
              <li> Fixed atom
              <li> Inter-atomic distance
              <li> Bond angle
              <li> Torsion angle<br>
           </ol>
		   The constraint is displayed in the Viewer and can be disabled by
		   clicking the checkbox in the Model View.  Only visible constraints
		   are active when minimizing the energy and when generating a Q-Chem
           input file.  

   </ul>
