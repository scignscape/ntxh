   <center> <h1> Plotting Surfaces <br> </h1> </center><p></p>
 

   <h3><a name="modelDensities"></a>Model Densities</h3>

   <p> Plotting the true density from molecular orbital coefficients is
   expensive and the high accuracy is ofen not required for a visual
   representation.  IQmol can generate the following model surfaces without
   having to calculate a wavefunction:
      
   <ul>
      <li> van der Waals surface<br>
	  <li> Promolecule density based on HF/6-311G Atomic Shell Approximation
           densities (for atoms up to Kr).<br>
	  <li> Superposition of Ionic Densities based on HF/6-311++G densities (for
           atoms up to Ar).  SID uses the current atomic charges to determine 
           the atomic density as a linear combination of the neutral and either
           the cation or anion density.
   </ul>

   <p> To plot any of these surfaces, bring up the molecule configurator dialog
   by double clicking the molecule name in the Model View.  Near the bottom of
   this dialog are the options for adding a surface.  Added surfaces appear
   under the 'Surfaces' sub-item under the molecule in the Model View.

   <p> To change the appearance of a surface, open the configurator by double
   clicking the desired surface under the Surfaces item in the Model view.
   This will open up a dialog similar to the following:

   <p><center><img src="images/SurfaceConfigurator.png" /></center></p>

   <p> The colors can be changed by clicking the colored buttons. The render
   style and opacity can also be changed via the correpsonding controls.

   <h3><a name="wavefunctionSurfaces"></a>Wavefuction-Based Surfaces</h3>

   <p> If a formmated checkpoint file is available (extension .fchk) then the
   following additional surfaces are available.

   <ul>
      <li> Molecular orbitals (alpha and beta)<br>
      <li> Total density<br>
      <li> Spin density<br>
      <li> Alpha (and beta) density<br>
   </ul>

   <p> To plot any of these surfaces the following steps are required:

   <ol>
      <li> Open a checkpoint file either from the menu or by clicking the 
           open button on the Toolbar. <br>
	  <li> Once the file has loaded the molecule will appear in the Viewer and
		   the 'Moleculear Orbitals' sub-item will appear in the Model View
		   under the name of the molecule.  Double click the 'Molecular
           Orbitals' item to bring up the add surface dialog.<br>
      <li> Select the required surface and make any necessary changes to the
           parameters.  Several surfaces can be queued before calculating them,
           and this is computationally more efficient than calculating them one 
           at a time.<br>
      <li> Once the calculation of the surfaces has finished, they will appear
           as sub-items of the 'Molecular Orbitals' item.  The visibility of a
           surface can be controlled by the checkbox that appears next to it in 
           the Model View.<br> 
      <li> Double clicking a surface in the Model View opens a configuration
           dialog that allows you to change the appearance of the surface.  Each
           surface can be configured separately.
   </ol>

   <p> Note that the formatted checkpoint file only contains the cannonical
   orbitals.  In order to visualize orbitals of other types (e.g. localized
   orbitals), a cube file needs to be generated.


   <br>
   <h3><a name="surfaceProperties"></a>Displaying Properties on a Surface</h3>

   <p> A surface can be colored based on some property that can be evaluated at
   each point of the surface.  Distance from the origin and the electrostatic
   potential (ESP) based on the atomic charges are properties that are always
   available.  Additionally, if a cube file has been loaded with some other
   property, then this can be used to color the surface also.
 
   <p> To display a surface property, double click the surface in the Model
   View to bring up the surface configurator dialog.  Select the desired
   property from the combo box, the surface should update automatically.  A
   small delay may occur if the property is expensive to compute for each point
   on the surface.

   <p> The colors used can be configured by clicking on the gradient displayed 
   in the surface configurator dialog.


   <br>
   <h3>Notes</h3>

   <ol>
      <li> The value selected for the quality of the surface will determine
           how long it takes to evaulate the grid data.  Each step on the slider
           calculates about four times as much data as the previous one, and thus 
           the calculation will take about four times as long.  <br>
      <li> Once the grid data has been generated for a particular property
           (MO or density), additional surfaces (for example changing the
           iso-value) can be computed relatively cheaply.<br>
   </ol>
