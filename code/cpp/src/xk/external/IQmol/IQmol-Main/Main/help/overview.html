   <h3><a name="mainwindow"></a>Main Window</h3>

   <p> The main window of IQmol is partitioned into four main parts:

   <center><img src="images/MainWindow.png" /></center>
  
   <ul>
      <li> The <a href="toolbar.html">Tool Bar</a> provides access to common
           functions.<br>
      <li> The <a href="modelview.html">Model View</a> provides a
           hierarchical view of the data structures that make up the system.<br>
      <li> The History view displays the actions that can be undone.  Clicking
           on the item in the list will take the system back to that state.
           The Edit&rarr;Undo and Edit&rarr;Redo menu options can also be
           used to navigate the history stack.  The number of undo operations
           can be configured in the preferences.<br>
      <li> The Viewer forms the main part of the window and is where the molecule is
           is displayed.
   </ul>
       

   <br>
   <h3><a name="open"></a>Opening Files</h3>

   <p> IQmol's file IO is handled by the OpenBabel libraray which can handle
   many common chemical file formats including the following:
     
   <table cellpadding=4 cellspacing=1>
   <tr><td> <b>Type</b> </td>                <td> <b>File Extension</b> </td>  </tr>
   <tr><td> XYZ coordinates</td>             <td> .xyz </td> </tr>
   <tr><td> Q-Chem input/output</td>         <td> .inp/.out </td> </tr>
   <tr><td> MDL Molfile </td>                <td> .mol </td> </tr>
   <tr><td> Protein data back </td>          <td> .pdb </td> </tr>
   <tr><td> Chemical markup language</td>    <td> .cml</td> </tr>
   <tr><td> Formatted checkpoint files</td>  <td> .fchk </td> </tr>
   </table>

   <p> Check the OpenBabel documentation for other supported file types.
      
   <p> Files can be opened using the menu File&rarr;Open or the 
   <img src="images/buttons/Open.png"> Tool Bar button.  Additionally, 
   multiple files can be opened using the command line or, on systems that 
   support drag and drop, by dragging the file icons from the system file 
   manager into the Viewer window. 

   <p> Note that when opening multiple files, only the last one is displayed.  Use
   the checkbox associated with each molecule to toggle its visibility.


   <br>
   <h3><a name="build"></a>Building Molecules</h3>

   <p> By default, IQmol opens in build mode.  This is indicated by a red border
   around the <img src="images/buttons/Equipment.png"> icon in the Tool Bar.  Clicking
   in the empty Viewer window will create an atom of the type indicated by the
   Build Element button next to the Build button in the Tool Bar.  Clicking the
   Build Element button causes a pop-up periodic table to appear, from which a new
   build element can be selected.  

   <p> Additional atoms can be added by clicking on an existing atom and
   dragging the mouse.  This creates a new atom bonded to the first.  To create a
   separate fragment, hold down the <i>alt</i> modifier key when clicking in the
   Viewer window.

   <p> Bond orders can be increased by clicking and dragging between two
   existing atoms.  If no bond exists between the two atoms,  one is created.
   Otherwise the bond order is increased.  To decrease the bond order, the bond
   must first be deleted and a new bond created.

   <p>Entire frgaments can be loaded from an existing file by using the 
   <img src="images/buttons/AddFragment.png"> Tool Bar button.

   <p> IQmol operates in free-form mode, which means standardized bond lengths
   and angles are not used.  It is recommended that after drawing a moleule an
   energy minimization is performed using the <img src="images/buttons/Minimize.png"> 
   Tool Bar button.  Note that if your initial structure is very poor, the
   minimizer will start off with too much energy and may not converge to the
   desired structure.  Performing an additional minimization should fix this.

   <p> If your molecule is symmetric, the optimizer is unlikely to find a
   structure with the desired symmetry.  If this is the case, a nearly symmetric
   structure can be symmetrized using the Build&rarr;Symmetrize Molecule menu
   option.  Finding very high symmetry may require relaxing the tolerance using
   the Build&rarr;Set Symmetry Tolerance menu option.
